Most likely only the giver and the receiver will be aware of it.And yet Our Lord holds up this small act of kindness as having tremendous value.Even the simplest acts in which we lose ourselves for others have eternal significance.

Through the sacraments of Christian initiation, the lay faithful participate in Christ's priesthood, and are rendered capable of sanctifying the world through secular affairs. Priests, in a way that is different in essence and not just in degree, also participate in Christ's priesthood, and are constituted mediators between God and men, especially through the sacrifice of the Mass, which they carry out in the person of Christ.Today, the day on which we celebrate Jesus Christ, the Eternal High Priest, we should pray in a special way for all priests.

Towards the end of His public life, Our Lord would often stay at their home. They were His close friends.

Timothy was also fairly young when he was appointed Bishop of Ephesus. Tradition tells us that he died a martyr's death in that city.Titus was one of St. Paul's most valued disciples.

Ten wedding attendants took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were foolish, and five were wise. The foolish ones, though they took their lamps, took no oil with them, whereas the wise ones took flasks of oil as well as their lamps. The bridegroom was late, and they all grew drowsy and slept. But at midnight there was a cry, 'Look, the bridegroom! Go out to meet him'\" (Matt. 25:1-6).This parable is about taking oil in our lamps. The oil that is referred to here is not the black, tarry stuff that comes about on the ground, but rather, everything that\\'s necessary in order to get us into the kingdom of God:..."

But whoever would be great among you must be your servant, and whoever would be first among you must be the slave of all\" (Mark 10:43-44).Christian life consists in imitating Christ. As a disciple before his master, as a child before his mother, so should the Christian be oriented in all of his or her activities before Christ.The child learns to speak by listening to the mother. He makes an effort to copy her words and mannerisms. And this should be the pattern of our behavior with respect to Jesus. We should imitate His every word and deed.Christian life consists in the imitation of Christ. \"For to this,\" says St. Peter, \"you have..."

Our Lord tells us in many different ways that prayer is absolutely necessary if we are to follow Him.In a discourse he gave in 1979 at the start of his pontificate, John Paul II said, \"For me, prayer is the first priority.

Vanity is the excessive pride or admiration of our own appearance or achievements.It means thinking of ourselves, the elation of self, leading to judgments, criticisms, comparisons, thoughts of self-excellence, patting ourselves on the back, dwelling on successes, not seeing our own faults but seeing the faults of others.The Book of Ecclesiastes says, \"All is vanity\" (Eccles. 1:2).

    <h1>Christian Virtues</h1>
    <p>By Fr. Conor Donnelly</p>

<p>(<em>Proofread</em>)</p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see
me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your
pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My
Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel,
intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>Our Lord tells us frequently in Scripture, “I have given you an example,
that you should do as I have done” (John 13:15).</p>

<p>There are many places where Our Lord invites us to follow His example.</p>

<p>St. Paul says to the Philippians, “Be you like-minded with Jesus” in the
same love, humility, obedience, and esteem of fellow man (Phil. 2:2).</p>

<p>To the Romans he said, “Put on the Lord Jesus Christ” (Rom. 13:14).</p>

<p>And in St. Matthew, Our Lord says, “Learn from me, for I am meek and
humble of heart” (Matt. 11:29).</p>

<p>We're called to share the life of Christ, to live an innermost
integration with Him, the vine, the stem. Our Christian life is the life
of a branch of Christ (cf. John 15:5).</p>

<p>It's a life of union with, and for union with, Christ. It's constant
growing into and growing out of Christ.</p>

<p>The more completely we grow into Christ, the stem, the more His holy
life lives in us, radiating His spirit, His life, His virtue, and His
holiness through our own life.</p>

<p>The more intensive and active our virtue is, the more we identify
ourselves with the Stem, and so, the stronger and more powerfully the
life of the Stem will flow into the branches, awakening and developing
in them a life of Christian virtue.</p>

<p>Christian life is growth. It's a constant process of progression to
higher and higher consciousness, a ceaseless urge toward unity and
perfection in God's image.</p>

<p>When we've cleansed our heart of sin and error, when, with prayer and
contrition, with the help of God's grace, we have destroyed self-love
and all its essentials, the way to enlightenment is open.</p>

<p>We have to try and grow in that process of purification as a consequence
of the gradually acquired appreciation of the supernatural and human,
divine truths and values.</p>

<p>We become more completely convinced that “only one thing is necessary”
(Luke 10:42).</p>

<p>The acquisition of virtue becomes more and more important. The whole
goal of our Christian life can be focused on that deeper acquisition of
virtue.</p>

<p>Day by day and week by week, Our Lord may show us in clearer ways what
particular virtue He wants us to focus on this particular day or week.</p>

<p>“What does it profit a man that he gains the whole world but loses his
own soul?” (Matt. 16:26).</p>

<p>We also know that purification from sin and the want of faith is not
enough. The path to holiness leads us on to the development in Christian
virtue, to illumination.</p>

<p>Christ Himself is our example and also the source of strength. We turn
to Him as a flower turns to the sun. Our thoughts, our inclinations and
wishes, revolve around Him.</p>

<p>The Book of Songs says, “Draw me; we will run after you to the odor of
your ointments” (Song 1:3)—your virtue and your holiness.</p>

<p>We desire to be enlightened by Him, the divine sun, so that we can
develop our likeness to Him, because it's to that end that God has
created us, predestined us, as St. Paul said, “to be made conformable to
the image of his Son” (Rom 8:29).</p>

<p>Natural progress in sanctifying grace that we received in Baptism
demands that we should take the road of Christian virtues.</p>

<p>After cleansing our soul from sin, the intensive and positive
application to developing the life of virtue becomes more important, in
conscious imitation of Our Lord's life on earth.</p>

<p>God the Father said, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased;
hear you him” (Matt. 17:5).</p>

<p>With these words, God the Father emphatically held up Christ to us, His
own Son made man, as our pattern and teacher. “Hear you him.” Imitate
Him. Live His life with Him.</p>

<p>Christ is the manifestation of God in human form. When He appears as
man, He lives and acts in all things as God lives and is obliged by His
nature to act.</p>

<p>He is God dwelling among us, showing us how we must live in order to be
pleasing to God. Everything He did in His life on earth was perfect and
holy, first, because of the inner love that governed His actions, and
then because of the manner in which He lived.</p>

<p>Even His least significant act was performed divinely; it was the work
of God and therefore completely pleasing to the Father. And so, all the
works of Jesus are an example, a pattern of holiness for us to follow.</p>

<p>“I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done” (John
13:15). It's the express will of the Father that we should follow the
life of Jesus and live as He lived, in imitation of all His virtues.</p>

<p>Christ's express will is also transmitted in those words: “Learn from
me, for I am meek and humble of heart” (Matt. 11:29).</p>

<p>“Put on the Lord Jesus Christ,” says St. Paul (Rom. 13:14). “Be of
like-mindedness with Jesus” (Phil. 2:5).</p>

<p>We're encouraged to acquire Christ's virtues to such an extent that
St. Paul says, “Not I, but Christ, lives in me” (Gal 2:20), lost
completely in Christ's likeness, a radiation of His spirit and virtue.</p>

<p>The mystery of our living unity with Christ reveals to us the purpose of
our striving for virtue. Virtue is the expression, the natural radiation
of “our living in Christ.”</p>

<p>“I am the vine; you are the branches. He that lives in me and I in him,
he shall bring forth much fruit” (John 15:5).</p>

<p>Our virtue is the measure of our life in Christ. It is also the food
that nourishes that life.</p>

<p>Divorced from a conscious effort to acquire virtue and develop it, life
in Christ and with Christ is unthinkable.</p>

<p>That conscious effort to acquire virtue is very important to live
Christ's life with Him.</p>

<p>A life of virtue is not a matter of entirely free choice, but in some
way, it's an inescapable duty which our integration with Christ,
through Baptism, imposes upon us.</p>

<p>“Be you perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect” (Matt. 5:48).</p>

<p>St. Paul says, “Do you also reckon that you are dead to sin through
Baptism, but alive unto God in Christ” (Rom. 6:11).</p>

<p>We're called to be alive to God. Every creature in the world is alive
to God: the grass that grows, the trees that bloom, the flowers that
bloom. They're alive to His voice. They respond to His call.</p>

<p>We have the capacity to be alive or not to be alive. We live for Him to
the extent to which we live the life of Christ, the stem, in honest
striving for virtue and with the constant growth in virtue.</p>

<p>That particularly includes moments of trial, of the cross, of
difficulty, of contradiction, misunderstanding, failure, illness.</p>

<p>In striving for humility, for self-denial, for purity, for courage, for
surrender to the Father, we are branches of Christ, the stem. We renew
and keep alive His humility, His self-denial, His love and purity and
strength.</p>

<p>When the baptized Christian, the branch of Christ, bows in humility,
that humility is absorbed in the self-humiliation that Christ practiced
on earth when He was made man, when He was subject to Mary and Joseph,
when He washed the feet of the apostles.</p>

<p>It is His humility in which He, through us, the branches, worships and
glorifies the Father.</p>

<p>Our poverty of spirit attaches itself to the poverty Our Lord chose in
the crib, in the flight into Egypt, in Nazareth, in His life on earth
when He possessed nothing and “had no place to lay His head” (Matt.
8:20).</p>

<p>It's His poverty that He lives again in us, condemning the avarice of
the world and honoring the Father.</p>

<p>In the whole universe there is only One who honors the Father as He
deserves; only One who perfectly prays, who humbles Himself and is
completely poor in spirit, and that One is Christ.</p>

<p>But we are an integral part of Him. He continues to live His life of
virtue in us, to the glory of the Father.</p>

<p>St. Augustine says, “Stem and branches are so completely one that
whatever the one may be, the other is also, nor can they be separated
from one another.”</p>

<p>To be a Christian, a branch of Christ, and not to live the virtue of
Christ, the stem, is a contradiction.</p>

<p>Our unity with Christ, the stem, gives our Christian virtue superior
value and priority over purely natural human virtue.</p>

<p>These are reasons for striving with all our might for that acquisition
of a life of virtue. Virtue must constantly grow and increase in
strength.</p>

<p>Supernatural life enters us as a force, a force that awakens the powers
of the soul, the mind, the will, and awakens the heart to a new
realization of God's light of truth and a new urge to live for God, to
work for Him, to overcome, to renounce, to suffer everything for love of
Him and constantly to aim at holier, more perfect works.</p>

<p>A new wave of life floods our being, drawing us with it; a divine power,
eliciting ever more energy from the soul and raising our customary
existence to an altogether higher level.</p>

<p>It's the nature of the Christian in us to develop and grow. There can
be no standing still; whoever ceases to progress, deteriorates.</p>

<p>Natural virtue advances toward perfection by character building,
learning, courage.</p>

<p>It's different with divine Christian virtue. A person may reach a high
degree of efficiency and virtuosity through his own will power, through
effort, diligence, and constant practice.</p>

<p>Divine virtue, on the other hand, can only be given by God. He raises us
from the lower stages of grace and virtue to the higher grade; He makes
everything clearer with His light and floods us with more divine life
than we enjoyed before.</p>

<p>We owe our growth in virtue to God, and after, we await it patiently,
seeking it from Him. God gives the increase.</p>

<p>He gives us three aids in fostering the growth of divine virtue. The
first rests upon the sacraments, in particular, the Blessed Eucharist.
They have the special function of increasing sanctifying grace in us.
With this increase, divine virtues automatically grow.</p>

<p>The good works we do are a second aid to growth. Our works cannot, of
themselves, transport us to a higher degree of divine virtue, but they
can move God to increase and strengthen us.</p>

<p>Every act of virtue, every good deed, makes us more pleasing to God; and
God's satisfaction leads to an increase of virtue in us.</p>

<p>The third is prayer. “Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after
justice, for they shall have their fill” (Matt 5:6). Justice is a
certain perfection in virtue.</p>

<p>Prayer stimulates growth in two ways: by being a good act and, hence, by
meriting an increase in the growth of virtue, like any other good deed.
It has a value of its own, a “petition value.” “Ask and you shall
receive” (John 16:24).</p>

<p>This petition value is increased when we consciously link our lives and
our prayers with the community of the Church, for we're assured that
“wherever there are two or three gathered in my name, there am I in the
midst of them” (Matt. 18:20), praying with them.</p>

<p>Virtue can also decrease. It can vanish entirely. With the passage of
time, we come to be more conscious of our weakness, our wretchedness,
our miseries. So inconstant is our will and our efforts. We're beset
very often by many difficulties, dangers, enemies.</p>

<p>The greatest enemy, the saints tell us, is venial sin, which is not
sufficiently rejected, not as energetically combated as it should be.</p>

<p>Venial sin hinders the growth of grace and virtue, bringing it to a
standstill. It can't attack grace and virtue directly; they are too
pure and divine.</p>

<p>But it can weaken the flow of life to the branch, thereby retarding the
growth of divine virtue, especially love.</p>

<p>Venial sins, like dense undergrowth, shut out the light from the tender
plants of grace and virtue, gradually choking them.</p>

<p>The poisonous roots of habitual venial sins damage the soil, wasting its
strength and infecting the atmosphere so that the sun-loving plants of
grace and virtue cannot live.</p>

<p>At the same time, they destroy many seedlings out of which virtues are
destined to grow. That is the pernicious work of venial sins.</p>

<p>Because of mortal sin, we may even lose the virtue God has implanted in
our soul, because mortal sin primarily kills the most essential of all
virtues, which is love.</p>

<p>Once love, which binds us to God, has been killed, all other virtues,
except for faith and hope, automatically leave the soul. The garden of
the Christian soul lies waste and desolate. All growth and life are
destroyed.</p>

<p>Only faith remains, a faint glimmer, together with hope, until the poor
soul, through unbelief and despair, destroys even these last memories.</p>

<p>Then night and barrenness descend. There is left only one pale light,
the baptismal imprint, which can never be extinguished. It lives on,
never ceasing to sigh for the return of grace and virtue.</p>

<p>All of us have proof of the wickedness, the sinfulness, and the
wickedness of our hearts. St. Paul to the Corinthians says, “He that
thinks himself strong enough to stand, let him take heed lest he fall”
(1 Cor. 10:12).</p>

<p>To the Romans he says, “It is not of him that wills…but of God that
shows mercy” (Rom. 9:16).</p>

<p>To the Philippians, “With fear and trembling, work out your own
salvation” (Phil. 2:12).</p>

<p>We can lose grace and virtue. We're all prone to sin and can only thank
the mercy and protection of God Our Savior if we are spared the loss of
grace and virtue.</p>

<p>Hence, how wise and prudent is the encouragement of weekly sacramental
Confession.</p>

<p>All supernatural graces support one another. They combine, increase, or
they decrease together. They do not stand, like so many trees, side by
side, each developing in its fashion.</p>

<p>It is more accurate to say that they constitute one tree, alive with
sanctifying grace, in which they have their roots; a single, complete
whole.</p>

<p>In the human organism, an arm does not grow by itself, neither a heart
nor a hand. All parts of the body grow together, fully dependent upon
one another.</p>

<p>It's the same with the organism of supernatural grace and virtue. All
virtues unfold together and increase or decrease by the same impulse.</p>

<p>It cannot be otherwise. All are closely linked by the virtue of divine
love.</p>

<p>St. Paul says, “Charity is patient, is kind, does not envy, is not
puffed up, is not easily provoked, thinks no evil, bears all things,
believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things” (1 Cor.
13:4-7).</p>

<p>The person who possesses supernatural love for God and for his neighbor
is strong and ready to practice every virtue whenever and however
opportunity occurs.</p>

<p>Love centers all our thinking, our striving, and our dealings with God,
regulating our whole life, both private and social, according to the
requirements of human and supernatural Christian virtues.</p>

<p>St. Augustine says, “Love, and then do what you want.” Whatever springs
from the perfect love of God is always good, pleasing to God, virtuous.</p>

<p>The person who has perfect love possesses every virtue: faith, hope,
true wisdom, courage, temperance, justice.</p>

<p>The more complete the love of God, the simpler and more fruitful our
life of virtue. Love is the soul of all the virtues.</p>

<p>It is therefore most important to strive for love and possess love. All
the virtues grow automatically and in pace with love.</p>

<p>Sometimes it happens that a person has one virtue but lacks others. The
person might be chaste but at the same time proud, vain. They might be
obedient, but also haughty; pious but unloving, self-opinionated,
impatient, selfish.</p>

<p>This is a disruption of virtues. It springs from the fact that the
person's concern is imperfect, weak in virtue.</p>

<p>Only where virtue is imperfect and weak do we meet caricatures of
Christian virtue, which may be all around us.</p>

<p>There's something magnificent about Christian supernatural virtue. In
this state we truly live the life of Christ with Him.</p>

<p>We can ask Our Lady to help us to sufficiently appreciate what this
means.</p>

<p>Mary, help me to have greater zeal in that quest for Christian virtues,
in that full realization of Christ within me.</p>

<p>Help me to be aware of any obstacles to that growth in virtue. Help me
to see what I must do.</p>

<p>Help me to be inspired by your words: “My soul magnifies the Lord, and
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior” (Luke 1:46).</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and
inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I
ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint
Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
Amen.</em></p>

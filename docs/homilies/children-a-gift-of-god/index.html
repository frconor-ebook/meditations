    <h1>Children, A Gift of God</h1>
    <p>By Fr. Conor Donnelly</p>

<p>(<em>Proofread</em>)</p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see
me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your
pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My
Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel,
intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>This meditation is about children, a gift of God. There's a phrase in
Scripture that says, in Latin, <em>Si scires donum Dei</em>–“If you knew the
gift of God” (John 4:10).</p>

<p>Gifts that come from God are very special. We have to try and appreciate
the gift, possibly seeing it from a supernatural perspective, with all
of the consequences.</p>

<p>There was a fellow in a class I used to teach many years ago in another
country who was a very average fellow, but he did extremely well.</p>

<p>He had three sisters; he was an only son. His father was very close to
him. He got into an Ivy League university in the States.</p>

<p>I'd often heard St. Josemaría saying we should be very good friends of
our children (Josemaría Escrivá, <em>Conversations</em>, Point 100). An easy
thing to say, but in my experience, not such an easy thing to achieve.</p>

<p>But this man had achieved it very well, and he was a very successful
professional businessman. I asked him, What was his secret?</p>

<p>He said, “I have given up the cocktail circuit and I try to be home by
six in the evening. I spend an hour with my son every day. We chitchat,
we're buddy buddies.”</p>

<p>Then I asked him, “But what gave you that orientation or that motivation
to conduct yourself like that?”</p>

<p>He said, “I was working in New York at one stage, and I knew a Jew on
Wall Street who was very successful. One time he invited me to his home
in upstate New York for a weekend.</p>

<p>“We got to the house, and it took us five minutes to get from the gate
to the house—and that's not because the car was breaking down. It was
a huge mansion.</p>

<p>“Then he showed me around this incredible mansion, room by room. When we
got to his own bedroom, there was a big sign above the bed that said,
‘The greatest failure of a man is to fail as a father.’”</p>

<p>This fellow says, “I was a bit perplexed. He was this man who was so
successful on Wall Street, and yet hanging over his bed was a sign, a
message, all about failure. I asked him to explain.</p>

<p>“He said, ‘You see, my kids were growing up. I was on the up on Wall
Street and I put them into boarding schools. Christmas time came and I
was very busy, so I just left them there. And summertime came and I was
also very busy, and I just left them there. That went on for a couple of
years. And now one of them is on drugs and another one is something
else, the third one is something else.’ He painted a pretty dismal
picture.</p>

<p>“This man said, “‘I came home to my own home, and I made out my own sign
and I hung it above my own bed, saying that the greatest failure of a
man is to fail as a father.’”</p>

<p>Fatherhood and parenthood is a vocation—something we have to respond
to. There's a grace for it.</p>

<p>There are graces for the battles of every day in that vocation,
something that we have to live out on a daily basis, maybe on an hourly
basis, to take care of that gift—to look at it from a supernatural
perspective, which means to look at it from the point of view of faith
and of hope and of charity.</p>

<p>God has great plans for our marriage, for our parenthood, for our
children. Our correspondence to that vocation comes to be something very
important.</p>

<p>I was living in a university residence in Spain at one time. After lunch
each day there was supposed to be a get-together for everybody.</p>

<p>There were about 100 male students in the university residence. But the
get-together competed with the siesta. So generally, there was about a
30 percent attendance. If there was an invited guest, that attendance
might rise to about 50 percent.</p>

<p>Then one time in the year, a lady was invited. All the guests were men,
and this time a lady was invited. Suddenly there was 100 percent
attendance. It was the event of the year. Nobody wanted to miss this
historic occasion.</p>

<p>Now this lady was a professor of psychology. She was a mother of eight
children. She was a member of Opus Dei.</p>

<p>She came into the get-together, and she started to talk about what it
meant to be a mother. I was a bit surprised. I was thinking, ‘I wonder
if she got her topic wrong. These guys are never going to be mothers.’</p>

<p>But then I looked around the room and all the jaws were hanging open.
They were all fascinated.</p>

<p>They all knew what a mother was. But it never crossed their mind for a
moment to think of what it meant to be a mother.</p>

<p>This lady talked about some very domestic little anecdotes from her
home: how she and her husband were both in academics; they were a bit
disordered by nature—one shoe here and another shoe there, clothes on
the back of the chair.</p>

<p>She said, “As our children grew, we saw how they were imitating our
example of disorder. And so, our battle in the home was to hang up our
clothes properly and to put our two shoes together.” She told some very
homey little stories.</p>

<p>But then she said that a mother has to be different things to her
growing children at different stages of their development.</p>

<p>To the two-year-old, she has to be the diaper changer, one of the
crucial services that she provides. To the six-year-old, she has to be
the Mum that gets down on the floor and plays with a doll's house or
the toy car or something.</p>

<p>To the ten-year-old, she has to be the good-looking Mum who puts on a
bit of makeup and gets her hair done so that when she comes to collect
her ten-year-old son from school he can dig the other guys in the ribs
and say, ‘That's my Mum over there, the good-looking one.’</p>

<p>To the sixteen-year-old, she has to be the intellectual Mum who knows
what's going on in the world, keeps abreast of current affairs, maybe
has a book going, and can engage her budding intellectual child in an
intellectual conversation, and doesn't give the impression that the
last time that an idea went through her head was before she got married.</p>

<p>This lady painted a picture reminiscent of St. Paul who says, “We have
to be all things to all men” (cf. 1 Cor. 9:22).</p>

<p>Just as a mother has to try and be different things to her growing
children at different stages of their development, so also, a father has
to be something similar.</p>

<p>The <em>Catechism of the Catholic Church</em> says, “Children are the supreme
gift of marriage and contribute greatly to the good of the parents
themselves” (<em>Catechism</em>, Point 1652).</p>

<p>They contribute greatly. Children are not just a burden or a problem or
a challenge. They are a pathway to holiness.</p>

<p>We have a special grace to grow in that pathway to holiness. There's a
grace there for all the challenges and the difficulties and the ups and
downs.</p>

<p>God wants us to become good at this business of parenting—good at
taking care of these gifts, the different ways that they express
themselves.</p>

<p>There was a man in Ireland many years ago—he was very successful
actually—one of the most prominent actuaries in the country. Very
prestigious profession there.</p>

<p>He began to attend recollections of Opus Dei. Little by little he sort
of went on to change. He said afterward, “You know, I always thought
that the most important thing in my life was my work.”</p>

<p>He had eight children, and through the formation that he received, he
said, “I began to see that my work is not the most important thing in my
life. The most important thing in my life is my family.”</p>

<p>The professional man that he was, he decided to make a paradigm
shift—to start to look at his family with the same seriousness with
which he looked at his work.</p>

<p>He installed a filing cabinet in his home. He opened a file on each one
of his children. He had weekly board meetings with his wife, planning
sessions, quarterly goals, monthly goals, weekly goals for each of the
children. He had five to ten-minute reporting sessions with each one of
the children.</p>

<p>He organized his family along the same lines as he organized his office.
He took that whole enterprise very seriously.</p>

<p>Pope St. John Paul II liked to say that “the family is the school of
deeper humanity” (John Paul II, Apostolic Exhortation, <em>Familiaris
consortio</em>, Point 21, November 22, 1981; Vatican II, <em>Gaudium et spes</em>,
Point 52, December 7, 1965).</p>

<p>Pope John Paul was full of very pithy, short little phrases that were so
instructive.</p>

<p>He talked about the “civilization of love” (John Paul II, <em>Letter to
Families</em>, February 2, 1994); the “culture of life” and “the womb is the
sanctuary of life” (John Paul II, Encyclical, <em>Evangelium Vitae</em>, March
25, 1995).</p>

<p>The family is the school of love, the school of virtue, the school of
piety, the school of the soul. He said, “The future of humanity passes
through the family” (John Paul II, Apostolic Exhortation, <em>Familiaris
consortio</em>, Point 86, November 22, 1981).</p>

<p>We can get a lot of mileage out of thinking that Christ spent thirty
years—not thirty days, but thirty years—living out a humble presence
in the family.</p>

<p>“He went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them.
And his mother kept all these sayings carefully in her heart. And Jesus
advanced in wisdom and age and grace before God and men” (Luke 2:51-52).</p>

<p>We have to try and create a family atmosphere in our home. Create the
home. The tables and the chairs and the furniture and the material
things don't really create the tone of the home. They help a little
bit.</p>

<p>But the tone is created by us, with our self-giving, in the fact that we
give importance to family life. We dedicate time to it, and thought and
energy and prayer. We try to be there.</p>

<p>Christ gives great dignity to family life. Part of that creating of
family atmosphere is family fun. Our best moments should be at home and
with the family.</p>

<p>Hopefully, our children feel the same way. They enjoy family life. Maybe
they don't enjoy their chores or their homework, but there's something
else there that they enjoy, something deeper.</p>

<p>We have to try and be available to our children, to play with them, to
do their thing, to talk to them. To listen to them. To attend their
sports matches, soccer or hockey or basketball, wherever it may be.</p>

<p>In a regular way, try to check their homework, partly because you want
to see how they're doing, but also to let them see that you're
interested. It's their work. Let them see that you value it, what they
spend their time doing, and the way they do it. With that, you
communicate to them that ‘your work is important to me.’</p>

<p>In all families, there may be moments of the cross: possibly sickness,
or contradictions, or pain, or failure, or the loss of a child,
miscarriages.</p>

<p>From your approach to all of these things, your children learn a lot
about life, to approach these realities with faith, aware that ‘I'm a
child of God. I'm carried in the palm of a God who loves me.’</p>

<p>God is speaking to us through the cross, helping us to grow in virtue.</p>

<p>Often those situations can be opportunities for heroic Christian
witness. You show children what real faith is, and what real detachment
or poverty is, or what real humility is.</p>

<p>If ever you lose your temper, try to apologize. If you lose your temper
and you shout and roar, the children learn that ‘it's okay to lose my
temper and to shout and roar.’</p>

<p>But if you apologize, they learn. ‘I have to be humble; Dad also makes
mistakes, and he makes up for it.’</p>

<p>Try to raise your children to be a good son or daughter-in-law, to raise
“great men and women” (James Stenson, Conference Talk, <em>Educating in
Virtue</em>, May 1996) who are not just successful materially, but who are
successful people of character.</p>

<p>Somebody once defined character as “that which you have left when
you've lost everything else” (Evan Esar). Some people in life lose
everything they ever had. But if they're people of character, they can
still be strong.</p>

<p>Raising children well doesn't mean to raise them to make a lot of
money, but rather, to be children of whom you're proud throughout their
lives.</p>

<p>God gives us a vocation to be a family man. Family values mean family
priorities.</p>

<p>I was talking to a man once who was not a philosopher, but he had an
interest in philosophy, and he realized there were a lot of bad
philosophical ideas traveling around the world.</p>

<p>He'd heard of some conference that was taking place in New York, and he
was thinking of traveling all the way to New York to say something and
to communicate certain ideas; to try and correct some of these wrong
ideas.</p>

<p>In the course of the conversation, he happened to mention how he had a
seven-year-old son, and the seven-year-old son liked to play basketball.
The son was always asking him, “Hey, Dad, why don't you come and play
basketball with me for a while?” He was always really busy.</p>

<p>I had to tell him, “Look, rather than jumping on a plane and going to
New York and talking at this great conference, maybe you do more good in
the world by just staying home and playing basketball with your son.”</p>

<p>Often God doesn't ask us to do extraordinary things. But he does ask us
to do the ordinary things extraordinarily well.</p>

<p>And that's the apostolate within the family. You have to be there. Be
there in the key moments of the lives of your children. What's going on
in their lives? What are they thinking?</p>

<p>That's what being good friends with your children is. That's what it
means. Friends are people who let down the drawbridge of their heart,
and let other people see what's in their heart. They communicate.</p>

<p>This business of building friendships with your children has to be done
before a certain age. Ten, eleven, twelve are key ages.</p>

<p>You have to work on things before that, because once the child gets into
the teenage years, as somebody said once, they enter the stone age.</p>

<p>They become monosyllabic. “Where are you going?” “Out.” “When will you
be back?” “Later.”</p>

<p>If you haven't built the bridges in the years of nine, ten, eleven,
twelve, you won't be able to walk along those bridges later when you
need to in the teenage years.</p>

<p>Our Lord wants us to be generous cooperators with the plans of God.</p>

<p>It’s very important to pray for your children. Pray for God's plans for
them, and to pray with them, so that they hear you saying the Morning
Offering, or your prayer to your guardian angel, or your <em>Memorares</em>.
They see that piety in the home is a real thing.</p>

<p>If ever your children are receiving any of the sacraments, try and make
that a big occasion: First Communion, Confirmation.</p>

<p>On my First Communion Day, my father told me he would allow me to do
something today that he would never allow me to do for the rest of my
life. I was really excited to know what this great thing was going to
be.</p>

<p>He said, “I will allow you to sit at my place at the dining room table.”
At breakfast that day, I sat in his place at the dining room table. I
felt like a king. But then he kept his promise: never again.</p>

<p>Sometimes there are little things we can do that don't cost any money,
but yet which conveys an important message about what is important in
our life.</p>

<p>Children are a gift of God, and that gift in particular is the gift of
their soul.</p>

<p>We spend an awful lot of time thinking about the bodies of your
children—clothes, food, all the material necessities, education. But
the spiritual realities are much greater.</p>

<p>One of the greatest truths of our faith is the immortality of the soul.
We don't think enough about the soul. If you think for a moment, when
was the last time in a newspaper article, a magazine, or a movie that I
heard anybody mentioning the soul?</p>

<p>All the great religions of the world believe in the spiritual nature of
man—Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Judaism, Christianity. Only modern
materialism says that man has no soul; he's just a thing.</p>

<p>Yet when God creates a soul and infuses that soul into a body at the
moment of conception, that soul is destined to live forever and forever
and forever.</p>

<p>There was a Protestant theologian once who was musing about the
immortality of the soul. He thought that the purpose of the soul is to
give God glory in this world, and then go to heaven, and give God glory
forever and forever and forever.</p>

<p>He was thinking, if that's the purpose of the soul, one of the greatest
things that any human person could do in this world is to bring souls
into the world to give God glory forever and forever and forever.</p>

<p>“And if that's the case,” he said, “contraception must be wrong.” So,
he changed his religion and became a Catholic.</p>

<p>Be affectionate with your children because everyone has a heart. And
every day, that heart needs a bit of affection, a bit of encouragement.</p>

<p>Try to be easy to live with. Parenting experts talk about how parents
and fathers should try to live as great men and women. Great men and
women don't demand more of their children than they do from themselves.</p>

<p>Children imitate people they admire, even unconsciously. Virtue means
power. If you're a man of virtue, you'll be a man of power. Leaders
don't just have followers; they have joiners.</p>

<p>A parent who goes to Mass every day, or practices some particular virtue
in a special way, leaves a great legacy, a great legacy or example to
children, an example they can't argue with.</p>

<p>Good example attracts. God wants you to feel proud and privileged to be
a parent, to have that vocation. It's a calling to a great mission.
It's a weight, but it's an honor.</p>

<p>Pray that your children someday will become masterpieces. It's your
pride and honor to see that happen.</p>

<p>One parenting expert says that the role of parents is to turn a gorilla
into an adult, because every baby that comes into the world comes into
the world like a self-satisfying hedonistic gorilla. ‘I want my milk and
I want it now. And I'm going to scream and scream and scream until I
get it, even if it's three in the morning. You'll jolly well get up
out of bed and give me my milk because I'm the most important person in
the world.’</p>

<p>The role of parents is to turn this little gorilla into an adult. An
adult is not somebody who can take care of themselves, because a
hothouse plant or a goat or a cow or a cat or a dog can take care of
themselves.</p>

<p>An adult is somebody who can take care of others, someone who can forget
about themselves.</p>

<p>God wants us to take a barbarian and turn him into a civilized man, or a
little daughter into a civilized and great woman, on whom every society
depends. Kids grow up when they can take care of others.</p>

<p>We try and value our children. Build up their self-esteem and
confidence. Above your work, we value you. Is this the best you can do?
Then, it's okay with us. Kids need praise.</p>

<p>Be aware that often they're confronted with great pessimism in society,
particularly in the area of sexual morality. ‘Don't fight against your
passions. You can't win. Give in. Here's a condom and it's free.’</p>

<p>Try to avoid corporal punishment. When you correct them, you're
impounding the lessons of moral life—that we must treat others with
respect.</p>

<p>You try to turn grabbers into givers. They don't come into the world
saying ‘please’ and ‘thank you.’ They need to be conscious of other
people's needs. They grow up when they finally do the right thing
without being told.</p>

<p>James Stenson, that same parenting expert, says that parents have to
repeat things 500 times for their children, and they only get them on
the five hundred and first. A lot of your sanctity may be tied up in
that repetition of 500 times.</p>

<p>Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, a famous German philosopher, said, “Treat
people as if they were what they ought to be and you help them to become
what they're capable of being.”</p>

<p>Teenagers are young adults. Treat them like that and they really
respond. Invest in their freedom and responsibility and you get a
responsible adult.</p>

<p>Great parents know that “no” is also a loving word. Children have to
hear words of loving denial from time to time.</p>

<p>The preparation of your children for marriage begins in their early
formation in virtue—in primary school, in secondary school. It
doesn't begin at the pre-marriage course. Your kids' future marriages,
to a large extent, will depend on how they treat their brothers and
sisters.</p>

<p>We can ask the Holy Spirit for grace to see what we need to encourage in
our children. Responsibility. Courageous perseverance. Self-control.</p>

<p>They might be great test takers, very skilled. But sooner or later they
run into trouble if they've little character.</p>

<p>Unity in the home is very important. Children grow to be confident men
and women when there's unity in the home, when they live in a safe,
loving environment. Confident people go very far in life.</p>

<p>The enemy of parents is not the future unemployment of children. The
goal is not just to make them technically skilled.</p>

<p>But the enemy of parents is not boredom. We're not just here to keep
them busy and active.</p>

<p>The goal, rather, is to raise children to become competent, responsible,
generous, considerate men and women who are committed to living by
principles all their lives, no matter what the cost. The goal is to
raise adults, not children.</p>

<p>When we look at the home in Nazareth, that place where Christ wanted to
spend so much time, where He grew and became strong, full of wisdom, and
the grace of God was upon him, we can derive a lot of inspiration on how
to take care and form and grow with the gifts that God has given to us.</p>

<p>We can ask Our Lady, Mother of the family and of the domestic Church, to
help us to grow in this area.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and
inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I
ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint
Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
Amen.</em></p>

    <h1>It Is Right and Just</h1>
    <p>By Fr. Conor Donnelly</p>

<p>(<em>Proofread</em>)</p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see
me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your
pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My
Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel,
intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>“Friend, I am doing you no wrong,” we are told in St. Matthew. “Did you
not agree with me for a denarius? Take what belongs to you and go. I
choose to give to this last as I give to you. Am I not allowed to do
what I choose with what belongs to me? Or do you begrudge my
generosity?” (Matt. 20:13-15).</p>

<p>Our Lord's words in the parable of the laborers in the vineyard are
addressed to everybody.</p>

<p>Justice begins with our relationship with God and is shown in our
readiness to give thanks” (See Gaspar Brahm, “<em>It is Right and Just:
Justice (I)</em>,” Opus Dei, July 10, 2023).</p>

<p>Our Lord talks to everybody throughout Scripture, using very simple
images taken from ordinary life; and with that He sheds light on the
most transcendental truths.</p>

<p>Farmers listen attentively when He talks about the requirement for seed
to bear lasting fruit (cf. Matt. 13:2-9). Fishermen enjoy [hearing]
Him talking about fishing nets (cf. Matt. 13:47-52). Every housewife
sympathizes with the story of the woman who loses a coin (cf. Luke
15:8-9), having had the same experience.</p>

<p>But nevertheless, some of His parables can leave us perplexed. Although
expressed in simple language, they place before us paradoxes that force
us to reflect.</p>

<p>We are told in the prophet Isaiah, “My thoughts are not your thoughts”
(Isa. 55:8)—Our Lord sometimes seems to want to tell us.</p>

<p>Possibly one of the stories that can cause most perplexity is that of a
property owner who goes out “early in the morning to hire laborers to
work in his vineyard” (cf. Matt. 20:1-16).</p>

<p>The narrative begins as we might expect: the owner agrees with the
workers on their salary for the day, one denarius, and he sends them out
into the field.</p>

<p>Initially we might think that this is a story about the use of time in
producing fruit. But as the parable progresses, the owner decides to
hire new workers later in the day, who will work fewer hours.</p>

<p>And instead of assuring them a fixed salary, he promises to pay them
“what is just” (Matt. 20:4).</p>

<p>One could look at that phrase, ‘what is just.’ That expression
necessarily gives rise to certain expectations in listeners and in
readers. They assume that those who started working later in the day
will receive less money than those who worked hard since dawn.</p>

<p>Those who started working late in the day are paid a denarius. When this
happens, we naturally think that those who started early in the morning
will receive a greater reward for their work. But the owner’s actions
surprise everyone.</p>

<p>Firstly, those who worked only a few hours, since they received the same
pay as the others; but also those who began working at the first hour,
since they would expect a proportionate increase in the agreed-upon
salary.</p>

<p>But perhaps we, the readers, might be the ones who are most surprised on
confronting such an unconventional concept of justice: “Am I not allowed
to do what I choose with what belongs to me?” (Matt. 20:15), the owner
of the vineyard asks.</p>

<p>Our Lord is not interested in resolving economic or political issues.
With this parable, He's not trying to clarify a concept as complex as
that of a just wage.</p>

<p>Above all, Our Lord wants to raise our eyes to God's merciful attitude,
His eagerness to welcome everyone, even if they come to Him at the last
hour of their life, like the good thief (cf. Luke 23:43).</p>

<p>But along with this fundamental meaning, the Master's parable provides
us with a narrative framework to help us reflect on the various
dimensions of the virtue of justice in our lives.</p>

<p>If, as has been traditionally affirmed, justice consists in giving each
person their due, what they truly deserve, then we are confronting an
interior disposition that highlights the human being's relational
dimension.</p>

<p>And so, we can ask ourselves, first of all, what we owe to God or what a
just relationship is with the one who is the Source of everything good,
beginning with our own existence.</p>

<p>In the Eucharistic Prayer of the Mass, we have a good starting point.
The brief dialogue between the priest and the faithful that introduces
the Preface says, “Let us give thanks to the Lord our God. —It is
right and just” (Roman Missal: <em>Eucharistic Prayer</em>).</p>

<p>Gratitude and justice might at first seem to be opposed to each other. A
gift is characterized precisely by being undeserved, while gratitude is
the recognition that a person has gone beyond what is strictly due.</p>

<p>But when facing God everything changes completely, since He is the
source of everything that we are and possess. St. Paul says, “What have
you that you have not received?” (1 Cor. 4:7).</p>

<p>Our life, therefore, is a totally undeserved gift; and so, with respect
to God, there is a deep duty of gratitude. We can never pay Him back for
everything He has done for us, and this is in no way unjust.</p>

<p>But it is something deeply due to Him, deeply just: thanking Him for
everything. “We do well, always and everywhere, to give you thanks…”
(Roman Missal: <em>Eucharistic Prayer</em>).</p>

<p>When we discover that our relationship with God is marked by His free
and loving gift, that helps us to accept joyfully our life as His
children, and it frees us from a view of faith that is excessively
focused on the “letter” of the commandments.</p>

<p>Instead of being overwhelmed by what could seem as an endless list of
goals or precepts by which we somehow try to “pay back” the price of our
redemption, we come to see our response to God's love as our
willingness to give Him every moment in our life, convinced that we will
never be able to thank Him enough for everything that He has done.</p>

<p>“We do well, always and everywhere, to give you thanks.”</p>

<p>And so, being faithful to a plan of spiritual life, rather than a burden
of conscience in the face of acquired commitments, can be seen as the
most direct manifestation of our gratitude to the love God bestowed on
each one.</p>

<p>In <em>Friends of God</em> (Point 167), St. Josemaría says, “if you are really
striving to be just, you will often reflect on your utter dependence
upon God and be filled with gratitude and the desire to repay the favors
of a Father, who loves us to the point of madness: ‘For what do you have
that you have not received?’”</p>

<p>God's justice is greater than ours. Fostering deep gratitude to God
frees us from the danger of seeking to judge His way of acting.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when we're suddenly faced with a situation we didn't
expect, we may ask ourselves questions [like,]{.mark} ‘How can God allow
something like this to happen?’</p>

<p>Perhaps we think other people are more blessed by Him, or that He
doesn't seem to hear our petitions, and we might think, ‘How unjust.’</p>

<p>In that case we behave like those day laborers who, after working all
day, couldn't accept the owner’s “excessive” generosity towards those
he hired late in the day.</p>

<p>Instead of being happy to see these workers given the resources needed
to buy something to eat, they're sad because their hope of receiving a
greater gift has been disappointed.</p>

<p>But blaming God for all the evils we see in the world makes no sense.
Many of these evils are the result of human freedom, of our own and
others' actions and omissions.</p>

<p>We also need to reach the conviction in our prayer that God is Lord of
our life and of history; and also that, although He doesn't really owe
us anything, He's always seeking the best for each person since He is
Love (1 John 4:8,16), transforming evil into good in surprising ways.</p>

<p>St. John Paul said, “In a certain sense, justice is greater than man,
greater than the dimensions of his earthly life, greater than the
possibilities of establishing, in this life, fully just relationships
among all men and women” (John Paul II, <em>Address</em>, November 8, 1978).</p>

<p>The prayer of those who know that they are children of God is marked by
trust in the One who loves us infinitely and always wants what is best
for us.</p>

<p>Jesus prayed in the Garden of Olives, “Father, if you are willing,
remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done”
(Luke 22:42).</p>

<p>Faced with situations that we fail to understand fully and that perhaps
cause us suffering, while trying to find solutions, we can also tell
God: ‘Let your justice be done and not mine. I know that I'm in good
hands and that everything will be for the best.’</p>

<p>We can remind ourselves that we are carried in the palm of the hand of a
God who loves us.</p>

<p>Justice is both a desire and a mystery. A desire deeply rooted in our
heart, but also a mystery that transcends us, in the sense that God
alone has the last word on what is just and on the specific ways to
restore justice.</p>

<p>And so, it wouldn’t be a Christian attitude to desire the punishment of
our enemies, as though it were up to us to decide on this, or to refer
too readily to divine justice admonishing people who worked immorally or
based their lives on values very different from our own.</p>

<p>Certainly, faith in divine justice should comfort us when we suffer an
injustice or when we are saddened by negative events in the world.</p>

<p>Pope Benedict has said, “There is justice. There is an ‘undoing’ of past
suffering, a reparation that sets things right” (Benedict XVI,
Encyclical, <em>Spe salvi</em>, Point 43, November 30, 2007).</p>

<p>Like the owner in the parable, God fulfils His promise and rewards those
who have worked well. But God's revelation of Himself ultimately leads
us to trust that His mercy will spur Him to always give new
opportunities for conversion for those who do evil.</p>

<p>The Prelate of Opus Dei has said, “It was not strict justice, based on
theoretical calculations, that led the Son of God to ask his Father for
forgiveness on our behalf, but a gratuitous love thinks only of what it
can do for others” (cf. Fernando Ocáriz, <em>Pastoral Letter</em>, Point 8,
February 16, 2023).</p>

<p>And so, the owner of the vineyard doesn't sit idly by after hiring
workers early in the day; even at the eleventh hour He wants to give
work to those who are about to waste a full day.</p>

<p>St. Josemaría says, “God does not let himself to be outdone in
generosity (cf. Josemaría Escrivá, <em>The Forge</em>, Point 623).</p>

<p>When reflecting on justice as a virtue that should shape our
relationships with others, it's often stated that justice is only a
minimum requirement for coexistence: respecting the other person in his
or her “otherness” (cf. Joseph Pieper, <em>The Four Cardinal Virtues</em>).</p>

<p>In that case, justice could be seen as a cold attitude that highlights
the differences between people more than what they have in common.</p>

<p>While charity seeks unity, justice would emphasize separation. However,
if we look closely, the relationship between charity and justice is more
subtle.</p>

<p>The fact that each person is given what corresponds to him or her, as
required by justice, is intrinsically related to the proper distribution
of goods, to compliance with contracts and one's word, and the respect
we owe to each person. We could say, then, that justice truly helps us
to lead a peaceful life in society, providing clear rules and preventing
us from hindering one another.</p>

<p>It's not something small or trivial to acknowledge the “otherness” of
other people and the right they have to be as they want to be.</p>

<p>St. Josemaría stressed: “We have a duty to defend the personal freedom
of everyone, in the knowledge that ‘Jesus Christ is the one who obtained
that freedom for us’ (cf. Gal. 5:1). If we do not do so, what right have
we to claim our own freedom?” (J. Escrivá, <em>Friends of God</em>, Point 171).</p>

<p>This is precisely what the owner of the vineyard reproaches the early
workers for, who feel cheated: “Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Did you
not agree with me for a denarius? Take what belongs to you and go. I
choose to give to this last as I give to you. Am I not allowed to do
what I choose with what belongs to me? Or do you begrudge my
generosity?” (Matt. 20:13-15).</p>

<p>Sometimes we can be tempted to disqualify in advance the opinions of
someone who has a different view of the world or is guided by other
values.</p>

<p>We then overemphasize the unitive dimension of charity, thinking that
any difference should be overcome to make room for true love, and we
confuse justice with mere equality.</p>

<p>But “justice is inseparable from charity, and intrinsic to it.” Pope
Benedict says. “Justice is the primary way of charity or, in St. Paul
VI’s words, ‘the minimum measure’ of it (Paul VI, <em>Homily</em>, August 23,
1968), an integral part of the love ‘in deed and in truth’ (1 John
3:18)” (Benedict XVI, <em>Caritas in veritate</em>, Point 6, June 29, 2009).</p>

<p>John Paul II has said that justice is the first aspect of mercy.</p>

<p>This virtue reminds us, first of all, that we all have the right to be
as we want, to manifest that way of being outwardly, and to enjoy our
own goods. Pope Francis writes, “no human individual or group can
consider itself absolute, entitled to bypass the dignity and the rights
of other individuals or their social groupings” (Francis, <em>Fratelli
Tutti</em>, Point 171, October 3, 2020).</p>

<p>St. Josemaría frequently spoke about the very diverse numerator enjoyed
by the people who followed him: the different ways of being, the free
opinions and personal options of each one, in political, cultural,
scientific, artistic, and professional matters.</p>

<p>He distinguished this from a common denominator, very small in
comparison, made up of the fundamental truths of faith and the charism
they all shared.</p>

<p>It does us a lot of good to value, respect, and love the legitimate
differences with the people who live with us (J. Escrivá,
<em>Conversations</em>, Point 98).</p>

<p>“This pluralism should be loved and fostered, although someone may find
this diversity hard to accept at times” (Fernando Ocáriz, <em>Pastoral
Letter</em>, Point 13, January 9, 2018).</p>

<p>The Prelate of Opus Dei says, “A person who loves freedom manages to see
the positive and attractive aspects of what others think and do in these
broad areas” (<em>Ibid</em>.).</p>

<p>Thinking otherwise would mean falling into the subtle temptation of
wanting to help others based on our own parameters, without discerning
what they really need and, above all, what we owe them.</p>

<p>It would be unjust, for example, to pay someone working for us a salary
less than what corresponds to the work they have done, simply because we
think it's better to give them a bonus that makes up the difference.</p>

<p>In this sense, the owner of the vineyard does not sin against justice by
paying everyone the same. We might think he has an unusual criterion of
just payment, but at no time does he break his word. Those who agreed to
a denarius received exactly what was promised; and the others received
what seemed just to the master.</p>

<p>This is how God is: the just keeper of His promises, but also a generous
Father, to whom, says St. Josemaría, “A smile, a word, a gesture, a
little bit of love, is enough for him to pour out his grace bountifully
on the soul of his friend” (J. Escrivá, <em>The Way of the Cross</em>, Fifth
Station).</p>

<p>In the final analysis, the establishment of justice and peace in the
world finds its solution in the human heart.</p>

<p>And, when the heart is not centered on God, a man reverts to his
original state of slavery and can be subject to every kind of oppression
from his fellow creatures (Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the
Faith, <em>Instructions on Christian Freedom and Liberation,</em> Point 39,
March 22, 1986).</p>

<p>We can never forget that when, through our personal apostolate, we try
to make the world around us more Christian, we are also making it more
human.</p>

<p>And, to the extent that we succeed in this, by creating a more just and
more human environment in social, family, and working conditions, we are
at the same time creating a climate in which Christ can be more easily
known and loved.</p>

<p>A decision to put into practice the virtue of justice, without
reservations, will lead us to pray daily for the leaders of government,
business enterprises, welfare services, for the solution to the major
social and human problems of today depends to a great extent on these
people.</p>

<p>And in doing so, we must endeavor to live up to this standard, without
inhibitions and without leaving to others the practice of justice which
the Church urges upon us.</p>

<p>This means full payment for services rendered. It entails a serious
effort to improve the living conditions of people in need.</p>

<p>It presupposes exemplary behavior in carrying out our work competently
and well, showing responsibility and initiative in the exercise of our
rights and duties as citizens.</p>

<p>Finally, the practice of justice will lead us to join movements in
which, together with other people of good will, we can foster more human
and more Christian ideals.</p>

<p>And all this, though it may seem to take up more time than is normally
at our disposal, is not impossible, because if we really make an effort,
God will enlarge our day.</p>

<p>Our Lord has left us a program of life which, if put into practice, is
capable of completely transforming mankind. He has told us that we are
all children of God, and therefore brothers.</p>

<p>This has a profound impact on relations between men. God has given the
goods of the earth to all to administer them well. To all He has
promised eternal life.</p>

<p>Some years ago, the then-Prelate of Opus Dei, Don Javier Echevarría, was
on a visit to Nigeria. In a get-together there, somebody stood up and
said, “Father, we have this great Nigerian problem, which is
corruption.”</p>

<p>Don Javier said to him, “I have news for you. It's not just the great
Nigerian problem. It's everywhere. But,” he said, “we have come to
change the way the world does business.”</p>

<p>It's a wonderful idea—makes us think, makes us dream, very relevant
to our personal apostolate, to our effort to be very moral in all our
business dealings, and to realize the great potential in the social
teaching of the Church there is, precisely to change the way the world
does business.</p>

<p>The doctrine of Christ has, over the centuries, led to great
achievements: the abolition of slavery; the recognition of the dignity
of women; the protection of orphans and widows, the care of the sick and
the handicapped. These are all a consequence of the sense of the
brotherhood of man resulting from the Christian faith.</p>

<p>In our own professional and social surroundings, can it really be said
that in word and deed we are truly contributing towards making the world
more just and more human?</p>

<p>St. Josemaría has said, “Perhaps you bring to mind all the injustices
which cry for redress, all the abuses that go uncorrected, the
discrimination passed on from one generation to the next with no attempt
to find permanent solutions. …</p>

<p>“A man or a society that does not react to suffering and injustice and
makes no attempt to alleviate them is still distant from the love of
Christ's heart.</p>

<p>“While Christians enjoy the fullest freedom in finding and applying
various solutions to these problems, it should be united in having one
and the same desire to serve mankind. Otherwise, their Christianity will
not be the word and life of Jesus; it will be a fraud, a deception of
God and man” (J. Escrivá, <em>Christ Is Passing By</em>, Point 167).</p>

<p>“God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son” (John 3:16).</p>

<p>“With justice alone, we cannot solve all the problems of mankind” (cf.
J. Escrivá, <em>Friends of God</em>, Point 172).</p>

<p>“Even if we achieve a reasonable distribution of wealth and a harmonious
organization of societies,” said St. Josemaría, “there will still be the
sufferings of illness, of misunderstandings, of loneliness, of the death
of loved ones, of the experience of our own limitations” (J. Escrivá,
<em>Christ Is Passing By</em>, Point 168).</p>

<p>Justice is enriched and [complemented] by mercy.</p>

<p>A number of years ago there was an earthquake in San Francisco, during
the time of the first Bush administration. Many people died, and there
was pandemonium. The president made an address to the nation.</p>

<p>In his first lines in that address were, “Thank God for the volunteer
effort.” Here was the president of one of the most powerful countries in
the world saying that with the Army, with the Navy, with police, with
everybody, with the health services: ‘We can't hack it, we need all
hands on deck.’</p>

<p>And so, “thank God for the volunteer effort.” It was the recognition
that the government alone cannot solve all the problems of society.</p>

<p>We need mercy, we need charity, we need contributions from everybody.</p>

<p>Justice is enriched and complemented by mercy. What is more, strict
justice, said St. John Paul, “can lead to the denial and extinction of
itself if no allowance is made for that deeper kind, which is love, to
form human life…</p>

<p>“It can end up in a system of oppression of the weaker by the stronger,
or in an arena of permanent struggle of the one against the other” (John
Paul II, Encyclical, <em>Dives in misericordia</em>, Points 12 and 14, November
30, 1980).</p>

<p>Justice and mercy mutually sustain and fortify each other.</p>

<p>“Justice alone,” says St. Josemaría, “is never enough to solve the great
problems of mankind. When justice alone is done, don't be surprised if
people are hurt. The dignity of man, who is a son of God, requires much
more” (J. Escrivá, <em>Friends of God</em>, Point 172).</p>

<p>Charity without justice would not be real charity; rather would it
simply be an attempt to anaesthetize one's conscience.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, one meets people who call themselves Christians but “leave
aside justice and limit their actions to a bit of welfare work, which
they define as charitable, without realizing that they are doing only a
small part of what in fact they have a strict duty to do” (<em>Ibid</em>.).</p>

<p>“Charity,” says St. Josemaría, “which is like a generous overflowing of
justice, demands first of all the fulfilment of one's duty. The way to
start is to be just; the next step is to do what is most equitable…;
but in order to love, great refinement is required, and much
thoughtfulness, and respect, and kindliness in rich measure” (<em>Ibid</em>.,
Point 173).</p>

<p>The best way of promoting justice and peace in the world is a commitment
to live like true children of God.</p>

<p>If we Christians really decide to practice the demands of the Gospel in
our personal lives, in our families, at work, and in our social life, we
will change society, making it more just and more human.</p>

<p>Our Lord Jesus Christ, from the stable of Bethlehem, from the Cross,
urges us to do so. Don’t be discouraged because it seems as if what is
around us is of little importance.</p>

<p>That was how the first Christians transformed the world: with their
ordinary daily work, which at first sight was a humble enough thing in
many cases.</p>

<p>We can ask Our Lady, in the company of St. Joseph, who worked to bring
about a more just world through the ordinary performance of their
duties, that they may lead us to follow very much their example and have
a greater impact in the society around us.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and
inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I
ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint
Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
Amen.</em></p>

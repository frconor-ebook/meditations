    <h1>Against All Hope</h1>
    <p>By Fr. Conor Donnelly</p>

<p>(<em>Proofread</em>)</p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see
me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your
pardon for my sins, and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My
Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel,
intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>“Who in hope believed against hope, to the end that he might become the
father of many nations, according to that which had been spoken, ‘So
shall your seed be’” (Rom. 4:18).</p>

<p>St. Paul says these words in his Letter to the Romans, referring to
Abraham.</p>

<p>Christian asceticism pictures man's life on earth as a journey that has
its end in God. We are all like men on a journey, a wayfarer, longing to
turn his steps quickly towards his definitive goal: God.</p>

<p>St. Paul VI says because of this we must all “provide ourselves with
hope if we want to walk with a firm and certain step along the hard path
in front of us” (Paul VI, <em>Address</em>, December 9, 1975).</p>

<p>If the traveler were to lose hope of reaching their destination, they
would not continue with their journey. The only thing that keeps the
traveler on his way is his trust that he will some day reach his goal.</p>

<p>As Christians we want to travel very straight and fast towards
holiness—to God.</p>

<p>In human life, when a person sets themselves an objective, their hope of
achieving it is based on their physical resilience, their training, and
their own experience. When all is said and done, it's based on their
willpower which enables them, if necessary, to draw strength from their
very weakness.</p>

<p>To reach the supernatural end of our existence, we don't rely only on
our own strength, but on God, who is all-powerful. He's the faithful
friend who doesn't let us down.</p>

<p>I heard a story once of some people who were out sailing and a bad storm
arose, and the waters were coming in, and the waves were coming over the
edge of the boat. Things weren't looking good, and they were a bit
stuck.</p>

<p>But then around the corner of the head of land that was close by, they
saw a much bigger boat, a trawler, that was heading into the harbor to
take refuge. They were able to send a signal to that bigger boat.</p>

<p>They had sent many signals to the land before, but nobody saw them. Now
they sent a signal to this bigger boat, who saw the signals, and they
realized that the ability of the bigger boat to be able to help them
depended on the power of that bigger boat to be able to throw them a
line, to be able to pull them into shore.</p>

<p>But it also depended on the goodwill of the people in the other boat,
because if they were in a hurry into the harbor with their catch, or
they couldn't be bothered helping these other people, they might have
just passed them by.</p>

<p>But they had the power, and they had the goodwill, and they were able to
throw them a line, and they were able to pull them into land. And so,
they lived to tell the tale.</p>

<p>Our hope in Our Father God is based on those same two principles: He's
all-powerful, He's able to do anything; and also, He's all goodness.</p>

<p>Our trust in Him and our hope in Him is well justified. To reach the
supernatural end of our existence, therefore, we rely on that goodness
and power of our all-lovable Father God. He's the friend who doesn't
let us down.</p>

<p>His goodness and His mercy are not the same as the goodness and mercy of
men, which may frequently be “like a morning cloud, like the dew that
goes early away” (Hos. 6:4).</p>

<p>Thanks to the supernatural virtue of hope, a Christian can be confident
that he will reach his definitive objective, which already began with
Baptism in this life and will remain forever in the next.</p>

<p>This objective is not something merely provisional, not the point of
departure towards a further goal, as is the case with ordinary journeys.</p>

<p>The <em>Catechism of St. Pius X</em> says through this virtue, we hope and long
for that eternal life promised by God to those who love Him, together
with the means needed to achieve it and the support of His omnipotent
help.</p>

<p>The greater the difficulties and the weaker we are, the stronger our
hope in God has to be, for the greater His help will be. His closeness
to our lives will be all the more evident.</p>

<p>In his Letter to the Romans, St. Paul recalls how Abraham “believed in
hope against hope, that he should become the father of many nations, as
he had been told” (Rom. 4:18).</p>

<p>Pope John Paul I comments: “You will still say, ‘How can this happen?’
The answer is it can happen because it clings tightly to three truths:
God is omnipotent, God loves me immensely, and God is faithful to His
promises.</p>

<p>“And it is he, the God of mercy, who awakens trust within me; trust
which makes me know that I am not alone, or useless, or cast aside, but
rather I am a part of a salvific destiny which will end one day in
Paradise” (John Paul I, <em>Address</em>, September 20, 1978).</p>

<p>Abraham did not hesitate despite his advanced years and his wife's
sterility. He trusted firmly in the power and mercy of God, being fully
persuaded that “God is able to do what He promises” (Rom. 4:21).</p>

<p>And we, “Aren’t we going to trust Jesus Christ,” said one author, “‘who
was delivered up for our sins and rose again for our justification’
(Rom. 4:25)? How could God leave us alone to deal with the obstacles we
encounter which try to prevent us living in accordance with the call we
have received from him?</p>

<p>“He holds out his hand to us in many different ways: usually in our
daily prayer, in our fulfillment of the plan of life that we have set
ourselves, in the sacraments, and, in a special way, in the advice we
receive in spiritual direction.</p>

<p>“Our Lord will never leave us alone on our journey through this world,
and on which we frequently experience faintheartedness and weakness.”</p>

<p>A year or two ago there was a story in a newspaper about a
family—husband and wife and two children—that were travelling along
a road somewhere in Ireland. Suddenly the car went off the road and into
a river. Overturned.</p>

<p>The driver, the husband, and the two children were drowned, but the
mother managed to escape, even though she made many efforts to try and
save the children.</p>

<p>At the funeral of her husband and two children, her family gone in a
second, she stood up to speak, heartbroken. She said, “Cherish your
family. Your family can be here today and gone tomorrow.”</p>

<p>She also said, "If God has left me, it's because He has a purpose for
my existence.”</p>

<p>There was a woman at a very difficult moment of her life, possibly the
most difficult, who had learned how to see that moment with a
supernatural perspective, to have hope in God for the future when
nothing seemed to make any sense.</p>

<p>Our hope of becoming saints, of faithfully doing what God expects of
each one of us, depends on our accepting the hand that He holds out to
us. Accepting whatever comes. Seeing this is His will.</p>

<p>Another mother in a school somewhere in Europe was collecting her
children from school. She had an automatic car, and by mistake, instead
of putting the gear stick into reverse, she put it into going forward.</p>

<p>The car lurched forward and hit a three- or four-year old little girl
who was there at that school. She died instantly. The mother of that
little girl was standing nearby.</p>

<p>Of course, both mothers were heartbroken. But the mother of the dead
child was able to forgive the other mother, who was equally distraught.
They had to look forward to the rest of their lives with hope, with
peace.</p>

<p>This virtue is not based on our own worthiness, on our own personal
situation in life, or on the absence of difficulties, but on God's
will—on His will that we should reach the goal—a will which is
always accompanied by all the grace and help that we can need in any
possible circumstances.</p>

<p>If God allows situations to happen that lead us to put all our hope and
trust in Him, because nothing seems to have worked out, nothing seems to
be according to reason, it's because He wants us to put all our hope in
Him, to try and see that there's some great apostolic purpose in all of
those experiences.</p>

<p>It may be that in a week or two, or a month or two, or a year or two,
some other person will be brought in contact with us who perhaps has
experienced something similar. Because we've been there, we know what
to say to them; how to give them hope and trust, even when they have to
believe in hope against hope.</p>

<p>In <em>The</em> <em>Forge</em>, we're told: “Though I should walk through the valley
of the shadow of death, no evil will I fear. Neither my wretchedness nor
the temptations of the enemy will worry me—for you, Lord, are with me”
(Josemaría Escrivá, <em>The Forge</em>, Point 194).</p>

<p>So many places in the Gospel show us time and again how God is closer to
those who need Him most, inviting us to hope in spite of the obstacles,
or the setbacks, or the pain.</p>

<p>He has come to cure, to forgive, to save, and not only to preserve those
who are whole. He's the divine Physician who, above all, cures the
sicknesses of the soul.</p>

<p>“Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick”
(Mark 2:17). He says this to those who criticized Him for eating with
publicans and sinners.</p>

<p>When the things of the soul are not going well, when they have lost
their health—and we’re never completely well—Our Lord is ready to
pour out more care, more help. He doesn't abandon the sick person, and
He doesn't abandon us. He doesn't give up anybody for lost.</p>

<p>He doesn't leave us alone with our defects, with those things we can
and must improve, because He calls us to sanctity, and He has the
necessary graces ready for us.</p>

<p>It's only the sick person who can cause the medicines, and the actions
of the Physician who can cure all ills, to be ineffective by refusing to
take them.</p>

<p>The saving will of Christ for each one of His disciples—for us—is
the promise that we will reach what He Himself asks of us.</p>

<p>The virtue of hope enables us to see that the difficulties of this life
have a deeper meaning. They don't happen by chance, or by blind
destiny, but because God wills them, or at least He permits them, in
order to bring greater good from those situations.</p>

<p>That approach can help us in all the trials that God may permit in our
life or those in the lives of people who are close to us.</p>

<p>That approach can help us to strengthen our trust in Him, to grow in the
awareness of our divine filiation, that I am a child of God and carried
in the palm of the hand of a God who loves me, in spite of all
appearances.</p>

<p>This is the truth. It helps us to see that we can bring about great good
from those things.</p>

<p>It can help us to foster a greater detachment from our health and
earthly goods, to cleanse our hearts from intentions which perhaps may
not be altogether good, and to do penance for our sins and for those of
all men.</p>

<p>God tells each one of us that He “prefers mercy to sacrifice” (Matt.
9:13; Hos. 6:6), and if at some moment He allows pain and suffering to
overwhelm us, it's because it is good for us. There's a far more lofty
reason that we at times do not understand.</p>

<p>Fulton Sheen says if God allows hearts to be broken, it's because He
wants to enter into them a little more, wants to make them more
Christ-like, to form them, to fashion them after His own heart (cf.
<em>Through the Year with Fulton Sheen</em>).</p>

<p>Those heartbreaks are for our own benefit, for that of our family, our
friends, the benefit of the whole Church.</p>

<p>God wants our greater good in just the same way as the mother who gives
permission for an operation that will enable her child to become healthy
again.</p>

<p>It's at such moments that we have to believe with a faith which is
strong and to reawaken our hope, because it's only this virtue that
will teach us to regard as a treasure what humanly presents itself to us
as failure, or perhaps as a great misfortune.</p>

<p>These are the moments when we have to go close to the tabernacle and say
slowly to Our Lord that we want everything that He wants.</p>

<p>“This is our great mistake,” writes St. Teresa, “we do not resign
ourselves absolutely to the disposition of our Lord, who knows best what
is for our good” (Teresa of Ávila, <em>Life</em>).</p>

<p>In <em>The Way</em>, Point 773, it says: “Jesus, whatever you ‘want,’ I love.”</p>

<p>Whatever you allow, I, with your help, will accept as a great good,
without laying down any limits or conditions. I will always thank you
for everything, if you are close to me.</p>

<p>With a certain frequency, we have to call to mind our hope of ultimately
being saints. St. Paul says in the Letter to the Romans that “in
everything God works for the good” (Rom. 8:28).</p>

<p>We have to try and repeat that in the depths of our heart, even though
we might be passing through a great physical or moral difficulty that
possibly seems to have no solution.</p>

<p>A lady approached the Regional Vicar of Opus Dei in Argentina one day to
thank him for having given her a prayer card to St. Josemaría. He
didn't remember that occasion; he didn't remember this lady.</p>

<p>But she said, “Yes, a couple of years ago, you saw me on the street and
you gave me a prayer card. At that time my husband was about to divorce
me, my children were going through a bad time, I was unemployed, my
husband was unemployed. Everything was going wrong in my life and you
gave me that prayer card and I prayed it, and now everything has come
right.”</p>

<p>Very often God permits everything for our own good. He wants us to try
to overcome the way that we may tend towards selfishness, or sadness, or
mainly trivial objectives.</p>

<p>We're journeying straight towards Heaven. Everything has to become an
instrument to bring us closer and enable us to arrive sooner.
Everything, even our weaknesses.</p>

<p>We should frequently practice the virtue of hope in all that concerns
the state of our own interior life, particularly when it seems that
we're not advancing, that our defects are slow in disappearing, or that
we constantly make the same mistakes.</p>

<p>We might tend to see sanctity as something very distant from us; perhaps
just an illusion.</p>

<p>We need to have in mind at those moments the teaching of St. John of the
Cross, who says that the soul “who has the hope of heaven achieves all
that is hoped for” (St. John of the Cross, <em>Poems,</em> VI).</p>

<p>This virtue can be a great driving force in our life. It's the virtue
of people who keep looking up. They don't look down, particularly in
difficult moments. They see the supernatural aspect of everything.</p>

<p>There are people who don't receive divine goods because they don't
have the hope of receiving them, because their outlook is too human, too
narrow. They don't even glimpse the greatness of the goodness of God
who gives us His help, even though we don't in the least deserve it.</p>

<p>St. John of the Cross says, “To win love’s chase, I took my way, and
full of hope began to fly. I soared aloft and soared so high, that in
the end I had reached my prey” (<em>Idem</em>).</p>

<p>Our hope should be in God alone. It should be all embracing, childlike
as God wants it to be. Children don't just believe in their parents.
They hope in them for everything that they need.</p>

<p>When holiness—which is the final aim of our lives—seems far away, we
shouldn't slacken in our struggle to come closer to God. We should try
to have an ardent hope and to fulfil our duties, day by day, hour by
hour.</p>

<p>We have to try and put into practice the advice we received in spiritual
direction and the resolutions from our examinations of conscience or our
last day of recollection.</p>

<p>We should try and struggle resolutely against discouragement. Some
writers say discouragement is the greatest tool of the devil.</p>

<p>At a given moment we may only be able to offer Our Lord the pain and the
sorrow that we feel for our defeats—on battlefronts of greater or
lesser importance—and also, our renewed desire to begin again.</p>

<p>We struggle resolutely against discouragement. This would be a humble
offering which is very pleasing to Our Lord.</p>

<p>Hope encourages us to begin again with cheerfulness and patience, and
without getting tired.</p>

<p>We're told in the <em>Catechism of the Catholic Church,</em> “Hope is the
theological virtue by which we desire the kingdom of heaven and eternal
life as our happiness, placing our trust in Christ's promises and
relying not on our own strength, but on the help of the grace of the
Holy Spirit” (<em>Catechism</em>, Point 1817).</p>

<p>“Let us hold fast to the confession of our hope without wavering, for he
who promised is faithful” (Heb. 10:23).</p>

<p>“The Holy Spirit ... He poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ
our Savior, so that we might be justified by his grace and become heirs
in hope of eternal life" (Titus 3:6-7).</p>

<p>“The virtue of hope,” the <em>Catechism of the Catholic Church</em> says,
“responds to the aspiration to happiness which God has placed in the
heart of every man; it takes up the hopes that inspire men's activities
and purifies them so as to order them to the Kingdom of heaven; it keeps
man from discouragement; it sustains him during times of abandonment; it
opens up his heart in expectation of eternal beatitude. Buoyed up by
hope, he is preserved from selfishness and led to the happiness that
flows from charity.</p>

<p>“Christian hope takes up and fulfills the hope of the chosen people
which has its origin and model in the hope of Abraham”—who in hope
against hope, believed—"who was blessed abundantly by the promises of
God fulfilled in Isaac, and who was purified by the test of the
sacrifice. ‘Hoping against hope, he believed, and thus became the father
of many nations’ (Rom. 4:18).</p>

<p>“Christian hope unfolds from the beginning of Jesus' preaching in the
proclamation of the beatitudes. The beatitudes raise our hope toward
heaven as the new Promised Land; they trace the path that leads through
the trials that await the disciples of Jesus. But through the merits of
Jesus Christ and of his Passion, God keeps us in the ‘hope that does not
disappoint’ (Rom. 5:5).</p>

<p>“Hope is the ‘sure and steadfast anchor of the soul...that
enters…where Jesus has gone as a forerunner on our behalf’ (Heb.
6:19-20).</p>

<p>“Hope is also a weapon that protects us in the struggle of salvation:
‘Let us ... put on the breastplate of faith and charity, and for a
helmet the hope of salvation’ (1 Thess. 5:8). It affords us joy even
under trial: ‘Rejoice in your hope, be patient in tribulation’ (Rom.
12:12). Hope is expressed and nourished in prayer” (<em>Catechism</em>, Points
1818-1820).</p>

<p>Prayer is the language of hope. “We can therefore hope in the glory of
heaven promised by God to those who love him and do his will (cf. Rom.
8:28-30; Matt. 7:21). In every circumstance, each one of us should hope,
with the grace of God, to persevere ‘to the end’ (Matt. 10:22) and to
obtain the joy of heaven, as God's eternal reward for the good works
accomplished with the grace of Christ.</p>

<p>“In hope, the Church prays for ‘all men to be saved’ (1 Tim. 2:4). She
longs to be united with Christ, her Bridegroom, in the glory of heaven”
(<em>Catechism</em>, Point 1821).</p>

<p>We are told in the <em>Catechism</em>: “Hope, O my soul, hope. You know neither
the day nor the hour. Watch carefully, for everything passes quickly,
even though your impatience makes doubtful what is certain, and turns a
very short time into a long one.</p>

<p>“Dream that the more you struggle, the more you prove the love that you
bear your God, and the more you will rejoice one day with your Beloved,
in a happiness and rapture that can never end” (St. Teresa of Ávila,
Excl. 15:3).</p>

<p>St. John Paul II liked to call Our Lady “the Woman of Hope” (John Paul
II, Apostolic Letter, <em>Tertio millennio adveniente</em>, Point 48, November
10, 1994).</p>

<p>We can ask Our Lady to help us to cultivate that virtue in a special way
every day, particularly aware of the influx of supernatural hope into
our soul each time we receive the sacraments.</p>

<p><em>I thank you my God for the good resolutions, affections and
inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I
ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint
Joseph my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
Amen.</em></p>

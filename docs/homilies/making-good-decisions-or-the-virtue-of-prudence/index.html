    <h1>Making Good Decisions or The Virtue of Prudence</h1>
    <p>By Fr. Conor Donnelly</p>

<p>(<em>Proofread</em>)</p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see
me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your
pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My
Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel,
intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>“The Lord replied, ‘Who then is the wise and prudent steward whom the
master will place over his household to give them their allowance of
food at the proper time? Blessed is that servant if his master's
arrival finds him doing exactly that. I tell you truly, he will put him
in charge of everything he owns’” (Luke 12:42-44).</p>

<p>In all of His teaching, Our Lord places great importance on the virtue
of prudence. It is often referred to as the first of the cardinal
virtues. A cardinal virtue is a virtue on which many other virtues
depend. <em>Cardo, cardinis</em> in Latin means hinge. It's a hinge virtue.</p>

<p>In St. Luke, we are told, “The master praised the dishonest steward for
his prudence. But the children of this world are more astute in dealing
with their own kind than are the children of light” (Luke 16:8).</p>

<p>On another occasion, Our Lord talks about a man who was about to go
abroad “who summoned his servants and entrusted his property to them. To
one he gave five talents, to another two, to a third, one, each in
proportion to his ability. Then he set out on his journey, and the man
who would receive five talents promptly went and traded with them and
made five more” (Matt. 25:14-16).</p>

<p>Later on, Our Lord was to commend that servant for his prudence, using
his talents well, using his time well, thinking of the future, not
wasting opportunities.</p>

<p>“I glorify you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth”, we're told in St.
Matthew, “for having hidden these things from the wise and prudent and
revealing them to little ones” (Matt. 11:25).</p>

<p>There are many places in the Gospel where Our Lord uses the terms, “Be
watchful”, “Be wise as serpents and prudent as doves”, “The Son of Man
is coming at an hour you do not expect.”</p>

<p>The truly prudent person is always attentive to God's promptings.
Through his vigilant listening, he receives in his soul the promise and
reality of salvation.</p>

<p>The word ‘prudence’ comes from the Latin <em>prudentia</em>, contracted from
<em>providentia</em>, which means seeing ahead, having foresight. Prudence can
be defined as the virtue that disposes our practical reason to discern
our true good in every circumstance and to choose the right means to
achieving it.</p>

<p>Notice how prudence discerns the true good, not the false goods—the
authentic, deep, profound, true good in every situation, in every
decision, in every circumstance.</p>

<p>Prudence also chooses the right means to achieve it. Not just any means:
the best means, most fruitful means, most efficient, most economical.</p>

<p>The Book of Proverbs says, “The prudent person looks where they're
going” (Prov. 14:15).</p>

<p>St. Thomas Aquinas says that “prudence is <em>recta ratio agibilium</em> (St.
Thomas Aquinas, <em>Summa Theologica</em>. Question 57). It's the right reason
in action, right reason applied to practice, right reason in doing,
ordering things according to their end or their purpose—doing things
or using things for the purpose for which they have been created.</p>

<p>It's the virtue that has as its object to tell us what to do in each
particular case.</p>

<p>We're told in <em>Friends of Go</em>d: “‘The wise heart will be reckoned
prudent,’ we read in the Book of Proverbs (Prov. 16:21). We would have a
mistaken idea of prudence if we thought it faint-hearted or lacking in
daring. Prudence expresses itself as a habit that inclines us to act
well, by shedding light on the end and by helping us to seek the most
suitable means of achieving it” (St. Josemaría Escrivá, <em>Friends of
God</em>, Point 85).</p>

<p>It's not to be confused with timidity or fear or duplicity or
dissimilation.</p>

<p>It has often been described as the charioteer of the virtues. It guides
the other virtues: makes us prudent in our humility; prudent in our
order; prudent in our punctuality; prudent in our charity; prudent in
our battle to live the virtues of purity and chastity.</p>

<p>So many areas of our life need this virtue. We’re also told in <em>Friends
of God</em>, Point 164: “We have to be prudent. Why is this? In order to be
just, in order to live charity, and to give good service to God and to
our fellow men. Not without reason has prudence been called ‘the mother
of virtues’ and ‘the guide of every good habit.’”</p>

<p>There are many unforeseen things in human action, and that's why a
virtue then is necessary to point out the best means that applies the
general principles to circumstances that may be changing all the time.</p>

<p>It's prudence that guides the judgment of conscience. The prudent
person determines and directs his conduct in accordance with his
judgment.</p>

<p>We're told also in <em>Friends of God</em>, Point 87: “Wisdom of the heart
guides and governs many other virtues. Through prudence, a man learns to
be daring without being rash. He will not make excuses (based on hidden
motives) to avoid the effort involved in living wholeheartedly according
to God's plans. The temperance of the prudent person is not insensitive
or misanthropic; his justice is not harsh nor is his patience servile.”</p>

<p>St. Thomas Aquinas was asked once for his opinion on three different
candidates who were possibilities to be elected Master-General of the
Dominican Order, to which St. Thomas belonged. He was told that one is
very holy, one is very knowledgeable, and the other one is very prudent.</p>

<p>The answer of St. Thomas was: If so and so is very holy, let him make us
holy. If so and so is very knowledgeable, let him teach us. But if the
third person is very prudent, let him govern us, because the most
important virtue in governing is the virtue of prudence: to have
foresight, to think things through well, to see the consequences of our
actions, to make proper plans, to have vision.</p>

<p>Any person involved in the role of government at the level of a family,
of an organization, of a country, of a sports club, of a team, then that
virtue is the most important virtue that they need to have.</p>

<p>It's right reason governing our actions. It tells us how to do things
properly, to be calm, to be careful in our planning, to study things
well.</p>

<p>I heard once that Cardinal Ratzinger was visiting the University of
Navarre many years ago. He was being shown around the University, which
he enjoyed and liked very much, and praised very profoundly.</p>

<p>At one stage somebody was driving him somewhere in the car and asked his
opinion about a certain matter. Cardinal Ratzinger said: ‘I’d have to
think about it,’ or ‘I've never really thought about it.’</p>

<p>In other words, he didn't immediately express an opinion, the great
mind that he was. He had the humility to say, I need to think about it
and to think about it carefully before expressing an opinion.</p>

<p>Somebody else might have rushed in to give their two cents’ worth on the
particular issue in question. This great man paused and asked for time
to think about this particular issue.</p>

<p>If there's no prudence in our life, or very little, then our work may
be full of goodwill, good intentions—but it might have little fruit.</p>

<p>Prudence guards us against being impulsive. Being impulsive means not
engaging our common sense because common sense is given by prudence.
There's a saying in medicine that says, ‘commonest things are
commonest.’ Commonest things are commonest.</p>

<p>If somebody has a pain in their chest, you could think of a hundred
things that might give rise to it, but the most usual or most common
things are the most common things. Those are the things you've got to
think about first. Or the same thing for pain in their abdomen, etc.</p>

<p>Prudence helps us to think about the consequences of our actions—not
to rush rashly into certain situations, or saying certain things, or
having certain opinions. We gain a lot in wisdom by growing in this
virtue.</p>

<p>Humility can be very important when it comes to prudence, because if we
think we have all the answers, we can very easily make many mistakes,
and that's very imprudent.</p>

<p>God will help us if we use the means that He's given us. He's a
prudent ally if we use the means He's given us to study things
properly, or to read up on a certain topic, or to get advice.</p>

<p>To listen carefully is part of prudence, to ask the right people for the
advice that we need, not to listen to any Tom, Dick, and Harry that
comes along. Or to read what others may have written on a certain topic.</p>

<p>If we don't do such things, then we may be proud or we may be immature.</p>

<p>Prudence is there to decide what the best thing for me to do is, here
and now. What does God want of me in this particular moment?</p>

<p>Very often St. Josemaría, when a matter came up, would ask a few people
to study this thing, ask them to pray about it. We don't make important
decisions that affect the spiritual life of thousands of people before
praying and thinking about it very carefully.</p>

<p>“To be wise as serpents and prudent as doves” (Matt. 10:16).</p>

<p>I like to say that in matters of government, important things can wait.
Very important things must wait.</p>

<p>Cardinal George Pell in his <em>Prison Journal</em> talks about how various
people have written to him from all over the world, and often they offer
him beautiful little prayers or beautiful pieces of advice or quotations
from famous people.</p>

<p>One of the little phrases that he was sent from, I think, a famous Greek
philosopher, said that “truth comes with time” (cf. Lucius Annaeus
Seneca). “Truth comes with time”—sometimes it takes time for the truth
to come out.</p>

<p>I heard a famous philosopher in Asia, Fr. Joseph de Torre, saying that
patience is a great social force.</p>

<p>Often, we need to have the prudence to let time pass. If we have to make
a certain important decision, it may be good to sleep on it. Or just
sleep on it for a few nights.</p>

<p>Sometimes, things can look very different after a good night's sleep or
when we let a bit of time pass.</p>

<p>We get a new optical angle on things, a new dimension. Sometimes things
take time and it's good to delay them and allow that time to happen.
Things mature with time.</p>

<p>It may be good to consult other people, even on small things. Should I
buy this thing? Should I buy that thing? Should I make this journey?
Should I make this phone call? Is it really necessary?</p>

<p>Occasionally it may be very prudent to keep silent in a situation. For a
father, for a mother with teenage children—they may have heard all
your lectures already; they know all your points of view. But often your
silence is your greatest weapon.</p>

<p>Often the person who keeps silent is the one who knows the truth, and
that way, communicates the values, and often, communicates love.</p>

<p>We're told in the Passion of Christ that when Christ was asked by
Pilate a certain question, <em>Jesus autem tacebat–“</em>Christ kept silent”
(Matt. 26:63).</p>

<p>Euripides, a famous Greek philosopher, said: “Silence is wisdom's first
reply.”</p>

<p>We don't commit ourselves—leave things up in the air, often let
people work things out for themselves, or allow them the opportunity to
discover the truth for themselves.</p>

<p>We pray and mortify ourselves to be able to make good decisions, to do
things with calm.</p>

<p>Every time we receive the gifts of the Holy Spirit and the graces of God
in the sacraments, we can also ask Him for an increase in all the
cardinal virtues, the basis of so many other virtues—prudence,
justice, fortitude, temperance. We need them in so many things.</p>

<p>There's a point in <em>The Way</em> where St. Josemaría says: “Don't judge
without having heard both sides. Even people who think themselves
virtuous very easily forget this elementary rule of prudence” (J.
Escrivá, <em>The Way</em>, Point 454).</p>

<p>It’s very easy just to hear one side of the story. If a child comes home
and tells you all sorts of terrible things about a teacher, be prudent.
Go and talk to the teacher. Find out the full story.</p>

<p>Very often, educationalists say that a teacher and a parent should not
be separated. Don't let the child split the two.</p>

<p>The same thing with parents: always united. Go and ask your spouse what
the full story was. The child learns much more from that unity of
authority than it does from many other things.</p>

<p>Prudence lets us see things coming. At times, we may need just to let
them pass by, to know when to act, when to wait with patience, and to
know how to relate events to foresee the consequences they can have,
seeking always to do the Will of God.</p>

<p>We can see that it's a virtue that has many practical applications on a
daily basis. It’s very important for a mother or a father of a family
also to teach teenage children, as they grow, what the meaning of this
virtue is, so they come to be circumspect.</p>

<p>Part of this virtue means that we don't trust ourselves. We have
self-confidence, yes, but we also know we can make mistakes—and maybe,
big mistakes.</p>

<p>A style of government that fosters prudence is a very useful thing. Two
heads are better than one. Six are better than two.</p>

<p>You can apply this to all areas of government: of a family, of a team,
of a factory, of any organization, of our apostolate, of our work.
Perhaps to things we should read in our spiritual life. Or even when
we're buying clothes—not to trust our own judgment.</p>

<p>Some people may be very good at that; other people—it may not be one
of the talents that God gave them.</p>

<p>All virtues grow together. We need to try and acquire all the virtues
because God wants us, as a consequence of our Christian vocation, to
guide other souls.</p>

<p>Certain people that may have been entrusted with particular roles of
government will need this virtue a little more. The bishop, the pope,
maybe the parish priest are people who have command of areas of
formation.</p>

<p>If we're prudent, we'll be docile. Those people that have been placed
in positions by the Holy Spirit in order to guide us—it's very good
to consult them, to refer to the criteria that they may give us.</p>

<p>All this helps us to be a person of sound judgment and maturity. These
are great qualities to have in a human person: a person of sound
judgment and maturity.</p>

<p>When St. Josemaría was founding Opus Dei at the age of twenty-six, he
asked God for eighty years of gravity: to have the prudence and wisdom
of a person with eighty years’ experience, because he had to make many
important decisions (J. Escrivá, <em>Friends of God</em>, Point 54).</p>

<p>He also had a phrase where he used to say: Old age does not make you
holy. Sometimes young people can think that ‘all the holy people I know
are elderly people.’</p>

<p>But if we're a bit of a devil at twenty, we can be the same devil at
ninety. Virtue doesn't come with age.</p>

<p>As somebody said once, “Wisdom sometimes comes with age, and sometimes
age comes alone” (Oscar Wilde). You can say the same thing about all the
virtues.</p>

<p>Prudence may sometimes come with age, but sometimes age may come alone.
You can find some people who are very frivolous and superficial at a
young age, and fifty years later they're still the same.</p>

<p>Time alone doesn't make us better. It's one of the reasons why we have
to work on our improvement, because we're called to perfection, called
to holiness.</p>

<p>We need wisdom. This requires study, requires thinking, and that's not
compatible with intellectual laziness or passivity.</p>

<p>In spite of all our prudence, sometimes accidents happen. God's loving
providence plays a part in those accidents.</p>

<p>But in those situations, we have to try and accept the will of God and
realize that “all things turn out for the good of those who love God”
(Rom. 8:28). There's something good hidden in every situation.</p>

<p>There's a Chinese saying that says: ‘I've eaten more salt than you've
eaten rice’ I have more experience. It's prudent to consult people with
experience.</p>

<p>That doesn't mean that they have a Ph.D. They might have a Ph.D. in
life, a Ph.D. in their particular area of expertise.</p>

<p>They might be the most knowledgeable person on the planet, without ever
having gone to a second or third level of education. They might know
their stuff.</p>

<p>If ever, through imprudence, we cause things to happen that are not
necessarily the will of God, then we can ask forgiveness.</p>

<p>But also, we can try to learn how to avoid those things by observing the
criteria that we're given. It's the fruit of common sense.</p>

<p>This has very practical applications, like keeping our car in good
condition; driving in a sensible way; avoid driving at night or after
we've had a little bit of alcohol.</p>

<p>Or getting our work done on time; or foreseeing a whole pile of other
things that might occur as we go into this particular weekend. It can be
prudent for a child to get their homework done early.</p>

<p>Prudence can never be lacking in all the things that we do.</p>

<p>To acquire this virtue in our quest for holiness and apostolate can take
years. An Olympic champion doesn't happen overnight. We don't have to
run, and take things slowly and clearly, and not neglect any of the
steps that God wants us to take.</p>

<p>Very often we find that the saints, when they came across a particular,
difficult situation, often they kept silent and they prayed.</p>

<p>If you read the <em>Prison Journal</em> of Cardinal Pell, you'll find a
similar disposition there—great peace and serenity and joy in reading
the Psalms and seeing the Hand of God behind the contradictions that
came his way; the injustice.</p>

<p>But often if we keep silent and pray, things work out.</p>

<p>Imprudence can be shown in hurrying too much, doing things without much
thought, being intellectually lazy, avoiding thinking, being frivolous
or superficial, being inconsistent.</p>

<p>Our Lord wants us to practice particular prudence in relation to the
important things in our life, in our Christian vocation. He’s lit a
candle in our hearts. He’s placed a treasure there, on which many great
things depend.</p>

<p>“Don't forget,” says St. Josemaría, “many great things depend on
whether you and I live our lives as God wants” (J. Escrivá, <em>The Way</em>,
Point 755). He said that to every mother and father in the family.</p>

<p>We have to be careful with that vocation. The devil may be trying to
blow out that candle. We have to take care of our soul, which is
immortal and will live forever. We have to expose it to good ideas.</p>

<p>Sometimes, in the 1960s, you could hear parents expressing anxiety about
letting their children be involved in certain organizations in the
Church ‘because they might be influenced.’</p>

<p>We are influenced by everything. In the world we live in today, parents
need to take every effort to make sure their child is exposed to good
influences, and to limit the bad influences as much as possible.</p>

<p>Our Lord wants us to take care of our soul through the Sacrament of
Confession, exposing it to grace, be exposed to formation so that we
grow spiritually, doctrinally, intellectually, apostolically, humanly,
in all sorts of ways.</p>

<p>We need prudence in relation to the virtue of purity and chastity: to
take care of the places that we go to, the movies that we watch in our
home or on our computer, or the things we see on our phone, or the
messages we receive or send, or the people we mix with.</p>

<p>We need to be prudent in relation to our health: not to self-medicate,
to get advice.</p>

<p>We need to be prudent in relation to the sports that we practice.
Certain things may be inappropriate at certain ages: rock climbing for a
father of five at the age of 50, or tightrope walking for the mother of
four at the age of 45, or bungee jumping or squash at 55.</p>

<p>We need to be prudent in relation to our rest: to get the proper hours
of sleep.</p>

<p>Prudent in relation to our finances: to spend when necessary, avoid
frivolities, not creating needs for ourselves.</p>

<p>We need to try and be prudent in our work, becoming as specialized as we
can, knowing our job, practicing intensity, trying to learn to be easy
to work with, keeping the people around us happy with our courtesy, with
our communication. Fulfilling our duty, being in the right place at the
right time.</p>

<p>Prudent when it comes to study by putting our whole heart and soul into
what we're doing, possibly not listening to music at the same time, or
in the presence of a TV set.</p>

<p>Prudence in relation to family life, so that we're present in the
family. Our heart is at home. The best time of our life is at home and
with our family.</p>

<p>We need to be prudent in relation to dealings with people of the
opposite sex.</p>

<p>Prudence in relation to our readings. A man may become what he reads. If
that's so, then we need to be very careful of what we expose ourselves
to in our reading.</p>

<p>We need to be prudent about the things we hear and the things we pass
on. We can easily indulge in gossip.</p>

<p>It’s not enough to want to do good. We need to choose the right means to
achieve it. Life is a constant decision-making process.</p>

<p>“Don’t confuse serenity with laziness,” we’re told in <em>The Forge</em>,
<em>“w</em>ith neglect, and putting off making decisions or studying questions
that need attending to. Serenity always goes hand in hand with
diligence, which is a virtue we need in order to consider and resolve
pending matters without delay” (J. Escrivá, <em>The Forge,</em> Point 467).</p>

<p>In the Litany of Loreto, we refer to Our Lady as “Virgin most prudent.”
We don't just say that Our Lady was prudent, but the superlative we
use, “most prudent,’ is a translation of <em>Virgo Prudentissima.</em></p>

<p>“Most prudent” because she listened to what was said to her by the
angel. She got the message of the Holy Spirit. She made important
decisions—to go to visit Elizabeth, to go to Bethlehem; and she and
Joseph—the decision to go to Egypt.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and
inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I
ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint
Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
Amen.</em></p>

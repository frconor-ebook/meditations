    <h1>Christian Identity</h1>
    <p>By Fr. Conor Donnelly</p>

<p>(<em>Proofread</em>)</p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see
me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your
pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My
Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel,
intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>“Blessed be the God and Father of Our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed
us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, even
as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should
be holy and blameless before him” (Eph. 1:3-4).</p>

<p>Our personal identity is inseparable from our being Christians: He has
“blessed us in Christ.”</p>

<p>It coincides with our being of Jesus. Therefore, knowing and loving
Christ, we know and love ourselves better.</p>

<p>The goal of the Christian vocation is to identify ourselves with Him
until we have the same feelings as Him.</p>

<p>“Have this in mind in you,” says St. Paul, “which was also in Christ
Jesus” (Phil. 2:5).</p>

<p>Those things that are in Him are the divine and human treasures of His
heart, which depend on His being perfect God and perfect man: “love,
joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, fidelity, humility, and
self-control.” St. Paul outlined all of them for us (Gal. 5:22-23).</p>

<p>Christian identity is a gift that God grants us freely. We achieve it
through correspondence to grace and in following Christ according to our
own specific vocation.</p>

<p>For this reason, each of our actions, the interpersonal relationships of
friendship or work, are meant to be marked with this seal, coherent with
the personal call with which the Father has chosen us from all eternity.</p>

<p>Growth in our identity consists in learning to live according to what
one is. And since life on this earth ends with death, it's an
ever-developing task, because we'll only really be able to fully
identify ourselves with Christ in heaven.</p>

<p>From one's own identity, life acquires true meaning. Knowing and loving
God, we'll discover little by little the way in which that identity
illuminates every corner of our life, starting with the way that we
relate to those around us.</p>

<p>St. John says, “He who does not love his brother whom he sees cannot
love God whom he does not see” (1 John 4:20).</p>

<p>Both for the discovery of our own identity and for growth, we can take a
look at the episodes in the life of Our Lord.</p>

<p>The Gospels show us that Our Lord was always very aware of His personal
identity as the Son of God, and this was shown in a particular way
according to the stages of its growth.</p>

<p>We see it both in how He understands Himself and in the actions He
performs.</p>

<p>Regarding how He understands Himself, we see that He has a well-defined
understanding of Himself all through His life.</p>

<p>As a young child, we see Him staying on in the temple instead of coming
home with His parents (Luke 2:41-52). This shows that Our Lord was
already aware of His mission to redeem men and illuminate their minds.</p>

<p>We could say the same about His hidden life. Following the teachings of
St. Josemaría, we know that those years were not wasted years; that they
were also a time of redemption, therefore an awareness of and fulfilment
of His mission (Josemaría Escrivá, <em>Christ Is Passing</em> <em>By</em>, Point 22).</p>

<p>During His public life, Our Lord wants that awareness of and fulfillment
of that mission that He Has received to be known, not only by Our Lady
and St. Joseph but also by His disciples.</p>

<p>In St. Matthew, He asks them, What do people think of Him, and also what
they themselves believe. Peter's response: “You are the Son of God”
(cf. Matt. 16:13-16).</p>

<p>That receives the praise of Our Lord, because the knowledge of His
Sonship is not born of flesh and blood but the will of His Father (cf.
Matt. 16:17).</p>

<p>This means that the knowledge and growth of our own identity as adopted
children is also a gift that comes from God.</p>

<p>In addition to His awareness as the Son of God throughout His earthly
journey, His behavior also manifests that same identity.</p>

<p>During His hidden life, He did so through His obedience to Joseph and
Mary. We are told He “was subject” to His parents and “grew in wisdom
and age and grace before God and men” (Luke 2:51-52).</p>

<p>In His public life, when Our Lord wants His redemptive mission to be
known, we see in His Baptism in the Jordan the witness that the Father
and the Holy Spirit give of Him (Matt. 3:16-17).</p>

<p>Later it's going to be John the Baptist who presents Him as “the Lamb
of God who takes away the sin of the world” (John 1:29).</p>

<p>When John's disciples ask Him: “Are you the one who was to come, or are
we waiting for someone else?” Our Lord responds by pointing out the
works that He performs, thus showing that they express His identity: the
blind see, the lame walk, and the Kingdom is announced to the poor (cf.
Matt. 11:3-5).</p>

<p>Something similar is said to the Pharisees when they refuse to believe
in His mission: “But if I do them,” He says in St. John, “even though
you do not believe me, believe the works, that you may know and
understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father” (John
10:38).</p>

<p>Therefore, the works of Christ manifest His mission, and in turn, His
Divine Sonship.</p>

<p>He lives with an inner freedom compared to the casuistry of the
Pharisees, and therefore works according to His identity. He works
miracles on the Sabbath to show that it was for man and for His rest,
not the other way around (Matt. 12:1-8, 9-13; Luke 6:1-5, 6-10; Mark
1:21-26, 2:23-28).</p>

<p>He remains in continuous dialogue with the Father, since from Him He
eternally receives the Sonship and His mission in time. He orients His
action to the mission to which He has been called.</p>

<p>He goes tirelessly from one place to another because He knows they're
waiting for Him, thus showing the awareness of His identity. “Let us go
elsewhere,” He says, “to the neighboring villages, so that I may also
preach there, because for this have I come” (Mark 1:38).</p>

<p>He reaffirms His deep longing for the redemption in the face of those
who oppose Him, expressing His desire to allow Himself to be enmeshed by
love.</p>

<p>We're told in St. John: “This is why the Father loves me, because I
give my life to take it again. No one takes it from me, but I give it
freely” (John 10:17-18).</p>

<p>He fulfills the loving will of God always and in everything because in
it He finds His life and His food: “My food is to do the will of Him who
sent me” (John 4:34).</p>

<p>He knows Himself in the Father who loves Him and, for this reason, He
wants to do His will to achieve the mature and sacrificial interior life
that God wants for us, transformed by grace.</p>

<p>God counts on the knowledge and experience of the dynamism of human
existence, entering the principles of spiritual life that ordinarily
runs through souls, knowing some basic notions of Christian
anthropology, the essence of life, man's nature, and his relationship
to God.</p>

<p>And also be an expert in humanity. Each one of us has to cultivate this
in our life, following Christ along that pathway: a certain finesse, a
youthful spirit, an ability to dream in open horizons.</p>

<p>St. John Chrysostom says: “When he says, ‘You are the salt of the earth’
(Matt. 5:13) he is indicating that all mankind had lost its savor and
had been corrupted by sin. Therefore, he requires of these men those
virtues which are especially useful and even necessary if they are to
bear the burdens of many.</p>

<p>“For the man who is kindly, modest, merciful, and just will not keep his
good works to himself but will see to it that these admirable fountains
send out their streams for the good of others.</p>

<p>“Again, the man who is clean of heart, a peacemaker, and ardent for
truth will order his life so as to contribute to the common good” (John
Chrysostom, <em>Homily on the Gospel of St. Matthew</em>).</p>

<p>We find that Our Lord has a passion for people. We too have to try and
have a passion for people and for their formation.</p>

<p>God wants us to have a passion to form other people, to give doctrine,
to encourage everyone around us.</p>

<p>Relating with the varied friends that we may have provides us also a
capacity for listening, for empathy, for dialogue, which is so important
in the work of forming other people and passing on that doctrine.
Fraternity can be a school of friendship.</p>

<p>We also have to be concerned about having that impact on the formation
of others that work with us, personally discovering the Christian
dimension of service that every profession has.</p>

<p>Christ said, “I have come not to be served, but to serve” (Matt. 20:28).</p>

<p>“As I have given you an example, so do you also to others” (John 13:15).</p>

<p>And this, beyond human successes and failures, makes it easier to
understand from one's own experience the dignity of all noble work
insofar as it's a manifestation of service to charity.</p>

<p>That inner attitude of service is perfectly compatible with a healthy
professional ambition and with humility on the corporate ladder. May the
best person win, but may we give it our best shot.</p>

<p>It's perfectly compatible with a logical and responsible concern for
financially supporting oneself and one's family; for being men and
women who want to be, as their equals, holding their own amidst life's
challenges because their mission is to collaborate, to transform the
world, and bring it to God.</p>

<p>St. Josemaría recalls: Serving God, dedicating oneself to God, means
first of all knowing God, hence the need for philosophical and
theological training.</p>

<p>“And,” he added, “in order that all my children can, in a capillary way,
give true doctrine to millions of souls, we have an obligation to be up
to date in matters also temporal that somehow affect the Church, the
Pope, and all souls.”</p>

<p>Whoever has truly seen, heard and touched Our Lord remains in a
relationship of friendship with Him that continually renews his
identity.</p>

<p>On the contrary, whoever abandons that relationship with Him or lets it
fade somehow dies out. That person loses sight of who he is.</p>

<p>Archbishop Fulton Sheen used to say that a person who loses their faith
loses a piece of their mind.</p>

<p>You could also say the opposite. The more faith in God we have and faith
in Christ, the more we grow as human persons; the more our identity
becomes fulfilled as a human person and as a child of God.</p>

<p>This can lead us to consider our whole life as a response to a love that
has preceded us.</p>

<p>“He loved us first” (1 John 4:19), we're told, and that I have
experienced the encounter with Christ, who guides me through the Holy
Spirit.</p>

<p>The person who lives in this way grows according to their identity, and
they go through the various stages of their existence as a protagonist
since they realize that no one can replace them in being who they are.</p>

<p>God has a unique project for each person: “For this I have called you;
you are mine” (Isa. 43:1).</p>

<p>In this way, even crises, mishaps, all sorts of contradictions and
difficulties would make us not doubt the life-project that God has given
to each one of us.</p>

<p>In this sense, it can help a lot to ask ourselves: Do I consider and
express what I think of the talents, aptitudes, and dreams that I have?</p>

<p>This is very much related to the questions that St. John Paul II said
that each human person has to ask themselves throughout their life:
“Where have I come from? Where am I going? What is my life all about?”
(cf. John Paul II, Encyclical, <em>Fides et Ratio</em>, September 14, 1988).</p>

<p>These are questions of identity. And, he said, to a large extent, our
happiness in this world may depend on the answers to those questions.</p>

<p>We could also ask ourselves: Do I project myself into the future, always
open to what the Holy Spirit may inspire? The Holy Spirit may be full of
surprises.</p>

<p>We could find ourselves in different places and different tasks, with
different challenges from one moment to the next: a new child; a new
job; a new situation in life; a new horizon; a new aspect of our
apostolate; undreamt-of horizons of fruitfulness that God may place
before us, in and through which He wants us to “bring forth fruit that
will last” (John 15:16) as we forge that identity with Christ to become
a saint.</p>

<p>We could ask ourselves: What do I want to achieve with what I do now?
Why do I want this or that for myself? What are my underlying
aspirations?</p>

<p>Really, it's all tied up in the question: Where am I heading? Why am I
doing the things I'm doing? Are my intentions in the right place? Are
my goals in the right place?</p>

<p>Am I using all the means? Am I thanking God for every single one of
those means that He gives me, squeezing it for everything that it has?</p>

<p>Is my life primarily inspired by the Gospel, by love of God, by charity?
Because “the greatest of these is charity” (1 Cor. 13:13).</p>

<p>The disciples on the way to Emmaus—they said to one another: “Did not
our hearts burn within us while he talked with us on the road, while he
opened to us the Scriptures?” (Luke 24:32).</p>

<p>The pathway of our Christian vocation is not just a question of
continuing along the road, of not abandoning that vocational path, but
following it with a heart on fire.</p>

<p>We should try through our formation to configure our hearts in that way,
ask for that fire of the Holy Spirit. Ask Our Lord to give us the grace
to be so happy.</p>

<p>And like the disciples of Emmaus, we know how to overcome the fatigue or
the disappointments of the journey, or the contradictions, or the
challenges.</p>

<p>With renewed hope and happiness, we know how to go forward. Not only
that, but to open road horizons to others, so that they too can have
that personal encounter with Jesus.</p>

<p>“No longer do I call you servants;…but I have called you friends”
(John 15:15).</p>

<p>Our Lord places before us horizons that give meaning to our mission to
be “a leaven that will divinize men and, in making them divine, will
make them at the same time truly human” (J. Escrivá, <em>Letter 29</em>,
January 9, 1959).</p>

<p>St. Josemaría said to some of his children: “Your first apostolate is in
the home” (<em>Ibid</em>.).</p>

<p>He dreamed that homes would be “centers for the spreading of the Gospel
and its message” (J. Escrivá, <em>Christ Is Passing By</em>, Point 30).</p>

<p>This is the great heritage that we leave to society: that our homes be
truly domestic Churches.</p>

<p>He talked about “a great mobilization of Christians who would radiate
the love of Christ in their work and in their social surroundings...and
who, in doing so, would also contribute to improving the structures of
society, making them ever more human and suited to the life of God's
children, taking an active part in the solutions to the problems of our
time.</p>

<p>“By your lives,” he said, “you show the completely free nature of the
apostolic activity of every baptized person, carrying it out with all
the energy of your heart” (Fernando Ocáriz, <em>Pastoral Letter</em>, October
28, 2020).</p>

<p>The adventure of identity formation inevitably passes through the
heart—first of all, our own. What we transmit is nothing other than an
authentic life in which we have experienced the love of God.</p>

<p>And for this, we learn to reach the hearts of others. Only in this way
will we help them build their most essential truth, their most
characteristic and lasting self: their identity.</p>

<p>That’s why so much importance is given in the Gospel to heart-to-heart
formation and heart-to-heart dialogue.</p>

<p>We can ask Our Lady, the “handmaid of the Lord” (Luke 1:38), who was so
conscious of her own identity, and she lived out that identity in every
moment of her life.</p>

<p>Mary, may you help us to have that same clear Christian identity and
vocation identity that you had, in all the moments of our existence.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and
inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I
ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint
Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
Amen.</em></p>

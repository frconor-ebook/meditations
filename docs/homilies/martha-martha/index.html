    <h1>Martha, Martha</h1>
    <p><strong>Martha, Martha</strong></p>

<p>By Fr. Conor Donnelly<br />
<br />
(<em>proofread</em>)</p>

<p>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</p>

<p>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me,
that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence.</p>

<p>I ask your pardon for my sins, and grace to make this time of prayer. My
Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my Father, and Lord, my Guardian Angel,
intercede for me.</p>

<p>In the course of their journey, he came to a village, and a woman named
Martha welcomed him into her house. She had a sister called Mary, who
sat down at the Lord's feet and listened to him speaking.</p>

<p>Now Martha, who was distracted with all the serving, came to him and
said, Lord, do you not care that my sister is leaving me to do the
serving all by myself? Please tell her to help me. But the Lord answered
Martha, Martha, you are worried and anxious about many things, and yet
only one thing is needful. Mary has chosen the best part, and it will
not be taken away from her.</p>

<p>Our Lord is well taken care of in Bethany. These are his friends. The
Gospel tells of the arrival of our Lord and his disciples at the house
of these friends, Martha, Mary, and Lazarus. Later, our Lord is going to
weep when he heard that Lazarus had died. Bethany lies about two miles
from Jerusalem, and our Lord would stop there to rest in the home of his
friends before going up to the Holy City. He felt at home in that place,
surrounded, as he was, by joy and affection.</p>

<p>And that's how we have to try and welcome our Lord, who is in the
Tabernacle. He's the most faithful friend that we have. He deserves our
loving attention more than anyone else. Hopping in to say hi, saying
hello and goodbye when we come into a place where he's reserved.</p>

<p>Having that spirit of little children, who know how to greet their God
who's present in the Tabernacle. And in this warm, friendly
environment, these sisters, Martha and Mary, behaved with naturalness
and simplicity, even as they revealed different attitudes.</p>

<p>Martha, we're told, was distracted with much serving. You get the
impression that she may have been the elder of the two. Luke says a
woman named Martha received him into her house. She was completely taken
up with the work of tending to the Lord and his disciples.</p>

<p>There would have been plenty of things to keep her occupied, possibly it
was a numerous group and they had arrived unexpectedly. And
understandably, Martha wants to welcome our Lord in an appropriate
manner. But we know that at a certain moment, she lost her peace of
mind, and she became frustrated due to her misreading of the situation.</p>

<p>And Mary, on the other hand, sat at the Lord's feet and listened to his
teaching.</p>

<p>Martha was distracted from her task of preparing the meal. In her
eagerness to get the supper ready for our Lord, she becomes preoccupied
with a million and one little detail.</p>

<p>And her sister Mary prefers instead to devote herself to their guest.
St. Augustine says she forgets about her sister and sits before him,
doing nothing else but listening to his word. With the help of divine
grace, we have to learn how to live a unity of life, which consists of
the union of Martha's and Mary's attitudes.</p>

<p>Our love of God should be inseparable from our apostolic zeal and our
work should be well done for the glory of God. We can also try to work
with the knowledge that our Lord is always by our side, by living a
certain presence of God in the workplace.</p>

<p>And so, Martha showing a real sense of trust in her guest, complains to
our Lord. [”]{dir=”rtl”}Do you not care that my sister has left me to
serve alone? Tell her therefore to help me.” These are strong words
because Jesus is Divine Love Incarnate. And she's saying do you not
care? She gets it all wrong. And so, for many centuries, these two
sisters have been held to represent two rival lifestyles.</p>

<p>According to this traditional interpretation, Mary exemplifies the way
of contemplation, the life of union with God, and Martha is seen as the
personification of an active life at work. But Blessed Alvaro del
Portillo liked to say that the contemplative life does not consist in
simply being at the feet of Jesus doing nothing, that would be a
disorder if not pure and simple indolence.</p>

<p>We're told in Friends of God, for we must find God in our daily job,
transforming our professional work into the hinge on which our calling
to sanctity rests and turns. We should show our love for God through the
exercise of human as well as supernatural virtues. So, a lot of our
formation is geared towards growing in the human virtues of
industriousness, punctuality, and order, as well as those of the
supernatural virtues. It's very difficult, possibly even impossible, to
have a deep interior life and at the same time to live a vibrant
apostolate, if we lack a serious commitment to our daily work.</p>

<p>As ordinary people in the middle of the world, we go to sanctify the
temporal realities, that's where God wants us to be, in the traffic
jams, at the crossroads of society, in our office, in the home, in
whatever environment it is where God has called us to work. He wants us
to be working there in a serious way, putting all the human virtues into
practice.</p>

<p>For too long there's been a mistaken insistence on the supposed
incompatibility between secular work and interior life. And so one
writer on the Theology of Work says, nevertheless it is there in the
midst of daily work and by means of it, not in spite of it, that God
wants to call most Christians to live lives of holiness.</p>

<p>We are to sanctify the world and sanctify ourselves with a life of
prayer that gives divine meaning to earthly tasks. Hence it can be very
useful to practice what are called norms of always in our workplace,
acts of thanksgiving, acts of faith, acts of atonement, and acts of
hope.</p>

<p>Saint Josemaria said on one occasion while speaking to a large number of
people, he said: you must understand more clearly that God is calling
you to serve him in and from the ordinary material and secular
activities of human life.</p>

<p>Saint Josemaria says he waits for us every day in the laboratory, in the
operating theatre, in the army barracks, in the university lecture room,
in the factory, in the workshop, in the fields, in the home, and in all
the immense panorama of work. Understand this well: There is something
holy, something divine, hidden in the most ordinary situations, and
it's up to each one of you to discover it. There is no other way,
either we learn to find our Lord in the ordinary, everyday things of
life, or else we will never find him.</p>

<p>That is why I can tell you that our age needs to give back to matter and
to the most trivial occurrences and situations their noble and original
meaning. It needs to restore them to the service of the Kingdom of God,
spiritualize them, turning them into a means and a location for a
continuous meeting with Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>And so, this involves combining the love of Mary with the work ethic of
Martha. Our Lord responds to Martha with that affectionate advice:
Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things, and yet
only one thing is needful. Mary has chosen the best part, and it shall
not be taken away from her.</p>

<p>And it's as though our Lord was speaking to each one of us, as if he
said, Martha, you are worried about worldly affairs, but you're
forgetting about me. That's why we need reminders, reminders in our
ordinary work of each day, with an image of Our Lady, with a crucifix,
through an aspiration.</p>

<p>To use human things and human reminders to help us remember that we're
always in the presence of God and we have to give him all the glory that
it is due, there's no separation between our work life and our prayer
life. We have to try and turn our work into prayer.</p>

<p>He seems to be saying to her, you are deeply concerned about important
tasks, but you're neglecting the most important one of all, which is
union with God, personal sanctity. How very relevant it is for every
Catholic today to be reminded of that great message. We can be so caught
up with important tasks or deadlines or urgent things that need solving
that we forget about the most important concern.</p>

<p>If your worries lead you to lose the presence of God while you work,
well then those worries are not good for you, even though your work
itself might be good and necessary. St. Paul says you run very well, but
outside the course, very important for us to be running on the right
course.</p>

<p>Our Lord doesn't pass sweeping judgments upon Martha or Mary. He
responds to Martha's question with profundity by pointing to what is
most important in life, that being the presence of Christ in the house
so our Lord could make the same message to us.</p>

<p>Nothing can justify our forgetting our Lord in our daily work, not even
the most important of concerns. We cannot put him who is Lord of all
things aside for the sake of the things of the Lord. Are we so concerned
about the harvest of the Lord that we forget the Lord of the harvest?</p>

<p>St. John Paul said we certainly cannot minimize the importance of prayer
with the excuse that we're too busy with apostolate, with activities of
formation, with works of charity, etc., etc.</p>

<p>And so we need to have a unity of life, which is so vibrantly integral
that work itself will lead us to be in the presence of God. We'll be
more aware that the fact that I can do this work, think or use my hands
or my feet, or I have this energy or this health to be able to fulfill
this task is because God has given me that health or energy or ability
or talent.</p>

<p>And at the same time, those periods that we devote to prayer will help
us to work better. We're told our Lord went out into a desert place or
he got up long before daybreak and went off into a desert place and
there he prayed. His prayer came before everything. We can't expect to
reach a sort of an armistice of some kind between temporal occupations
and the spiritual life, between work and prayer.</p>

<p>Work feeds prayer and prayer feeds work. Blessed Alvaro also says this
is true, even to the point where work in and of itself as a service done
in a professional manner for man and society becomes an acceptable
offering to God.</p>

<p>And we're told in the Forge to maintain the presence of God while we
work, we need to resort to simple reminders, little things that will
help us remember that our work is for God. He is there next to us as our
companions, watching us as we work.</p>

<p>It may help us to recall that he is physically quite close to us in the
nearest oratory or church. From there, where you're working, let your
heart escape to the Lord, right close to the Tabernacle, to tell him
without doing anything odd: My Jesus, I love you. Don't be afraid to
call him so, my Jesus, to say it to him often.</p>

<p>A person who spent quite a bit of time with St Josemaria told me
recently how one time when St Josemaria was sick in bed, he called this
person to accompany him and he was telling him that from his bedside he
was greeting our Lord in all the different tabernacles around the place,
close to where he lived and also far away, being right close to our Lord
in the tabernacle.</p>

<p>And so all worldly occupations, when engaged in with the right
intention, allow us the opportunity to put into practice charity,
mortification, a spirit of service to others, joy and optimism, and
understanding. And in the apostolate of friendship and confidence, that
place where God has placed us opens this great panorama of
opportunities.</p>

<p>We sanctify ourselves through our work and that's what really matters,
to find Jesus in the middle of our ordinary daily concerns, not to
forget about the Lord of all things. And when our daily tasks are in
some way directly related to Him, we should make an even greater effort
to live this unity of life.</p>

<p>We can offer our work to our Lord before we start it when we finish, and
also in the middle, when we get distracted, otherwise we'll end up
doing what is in fact his work for ourselves, neglecting the Master.</p>

<p>Somebody asked Blessed Alvaro one time, what does being contemplatives
in the middle of the world mean in our case? He said, let me answer you
in a few words. It means seeing God in everything, with the light of
faith, spurred on by love, with the firm hope of contemplating him face
to face in heaven. It means seeking God in everything all the time.</p>

<p>Martha got a bit lost, a bit distracted. She began to focus on the
human. She began to focus on herself. Does it not concern you that my
sister has left me to serve alone? Three times she mentions herself in
one sentence, and so this idea of the unity of life and finding God in
the middle of ordinary things is very central to our Christian vocation.
In some ways you could say it's the purpose of our vocation, to
discover God in all the earth's pathways while helping many others to
discover Him too.</p>

<p>God, the creator of all, assures us that although He may be hidden, He
is there nonetheless in the middle of all our daily occupations. And St.
Josemaria says that either we learn to find our Lord in ordinary
everyday life or we shall never find him. Very often in the Gospel, our
Lord gives us a series of contrasts. Martha and Mary are a contrast, the
right way to go and the wrong way to go.</p>

<p>In the Church of the Eucharist, Pope St. John Paul said, to contemplate
the face of Christ and to contemplate it with Mary is the program which
I have set before the Church at the dawn of the third millennium,
summoning her to put out into the deep on the sea of history with the
enthusiasm of the new evangelization.</p>

<p>And so, St. John Paul liked to point to Martha, which we all are, and
said with the third millennium we all have to try and become Mary. It's
a program that the Church sets before us, before the whole of humanity.
He says to contemplate Christ involves being able to recognize him
wherever he manifests himself, in his many forms of presence, but above
all in the living sacrament of his body and blood.</p>

<p>And so, we could say, well Lord help me to see you, help me to find you
in those ordinary things. Help me to realize it when you're saying
something to me, you're pointing something out to me.</p>

<p>Our Lord loved to visit the home of Martha and Mary. He enjoyed their
gracious hospitality. He makes use of this occasion to show us these two
very different temperaments. Martha loved to serve, but in her anxious
manner of waiting on Jesus she caused unrest, she had a bit too much
serving.</p>

<p>As Mary in her simple and trusting manner waited on Jesus by sitting
attentively at his feet. Mary seems to have known instinctively that
what the Lord and Teacher most wanted at that moment was her attentive
presence.</p>

<p>There are times when our Lord wants us to stop what we're doing. When
Our Lady went to visit St Elizabeth, we're told she remained there for
three months, but then she went home. Even when we're doing very good
things there's a moment when it's God's will for us that we stop, we
turn to other things. Anxiety and preoccupation can keep us from
listening and from giving our Lord our undivided attention.</p>

<p>And so, the norms of our plan of life always have to come first. That
assures us of our unity of life, that’s the way that Jesus lived. And
our Lord invites us to give him our concerns and our anxieties because
he's trustworthy and he's also able to meet any need that we may have.
And so his grace frees us from needless concerns and preoccupation.</p>

<p>Our Lord wants that we would make a place for him, not only in our
hearts but in the daily circumstances of our lives as well. And so we
honor our Lord when we offer him everything we have and everything we
do. And in the Old Testament we're reminded that, well, after all,
everything we have is an outright gift from Him.</p>

<p>St Paul also says, what have you that you have not received? He also
says, whatever you do in word or deed, do everything in the name of the
Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him. And that means
even when things go wrong, when we break a plate or drop a glass or we
make a big mistake, well, in those moments, instead of crying over
spilled milk, we can offer to our Lord those moments of humiliation or
difficulty.</p>

<p>When we sit or eat or sleep or entertain our friends and our relatives,
we can also remember that the Lord is the guest of our home. He wants us
to bring Him glory in the way we treat other people and to use the gifts
that He has so graciously given to us, and in turn, He blesses us with
His presence, and He fills us with joy.</p>

<p>We're told in Scripture, Blessed are the clean of heart, for they shall
see God. The reward of a clean heart is freedom in the opening out of
our contemplative soul.</p>

<p>We see God not just in the next world, but in this one. We see him in
the ordinary things of each day.</p>

<p>And so, with the help of grace and those norms of always: thanksgiving,
atonement, faith, hope, and trust, we can achieve that presence of God
in all our actions and achieve being contemplatives.</p>

<p>The Catechism of the Catholic Church says contemplative prayer is
nothing out of the ordinary in the spiritual life, nor is it something
strange that only happens rarely and to unusual people. Contemplative
prayer, we're told, is what God wants for every Christian. The faith of
the Church leads us towards an affectionate, personal relationship with
the Blessed Trinity and the Church believes as she prays. Liturgy is a
constitutive element of the holy and living tradition.</p>

<p>And so Blessed Alvaro says we will not attain unity of life,
contemplation, dialogue with God the Father, God the Son, and God the
Holy Spirit, if we don't put loving care into the times dedicated to
talking to the Lord and that may mean that we have to be heroic in
finding the time or being in the right place to do our mental prayer.</p>

<p>We're told in Friends of God, spending time lovingly with each person
of the Blessed Trinity is contemplative prayer, a situation in which
words are not needed because the tongue cannot express itself. The
intellect grows calm, one does not reason, one looks.</p>

<p>Contemplation is essentially looking at God without needing rest or
feeling tired, and the soul feels and knows that it is under the loving
gaze of God all day long. People in love yearn to see each other.
Lovers, says Saint Josemaria, only have eyes for their beloved. It's
natural, that's the way the human heart is.</p>

<p>We're told many times in Scripture that Our Lady kept all these things
carefully in her heart. Mary lived a deep contemplative soul. No matter
where she was or what she was doing, as she left her house in Nazareth
to go to Bethlehem or to go to Egypt, or back in Nazareth at the foot of
the cross. Mary, help us along that pathway of conversion, from being a
Martha to becoming a Mary.</p>

<p>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and
inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation.</p>

<p>I ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint
Joseph, my Father, and Lord, my Guardian Angel, intercede for me.</p>

<p>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</p>

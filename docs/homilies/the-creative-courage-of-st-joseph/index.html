    <h1>The Creative Courage of St. Joseph</h1>
    <p>By Fr. Conor Donnelly</p>

<p>(<em>Proofread</em>)</p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see
me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your
pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My
Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel,
intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>We’re told in the Book of Genesis, “But when all Egypt too began to feel
the famine and the people appealed to Pharaoh for food, Pharaoh told the
Egyptians, ‘Go to Joseph and do whatever he tells you’” (Gen. 41:55).</p>

<p>There was famine all over the world, and Joseph opened all the granaries
and rationed out grain to the Egyptians as the famine grew even worse in
Egypt. People came to Egypt from all over the world to get supplies from
Joseph, for the famine had grown severe throughout the world.</p>

<p>Jacob, seeing that there were supplies to be had in Egypt, said to his
sons, “Why do you keep staring at one another? I hear,” he said, “that
there are supplies in Egypt. Go down and procure some for us there, so
that we may survive and not die” (Gen. 42:1-3). So ten of Joseph's
brothers went down to procure grain in Egypt.</p>

<p>We're halfway through this Year of St. Joseph, a special year given to
us, possibly the only year in the whole of our life that will be
dedicated to St. Joseph, a special fruit of the Pontificate of Pope
Francis, now recovering in hospital.</p>

<p>And we're halfway through this special year. It's a good moment for us
to take stock and see how we are living this year of St. Joseph and to
begin again in our devotion to him.</p>

<p>The Holy Father, in his letter for this year, ‘<em>With the Father's
Heart,</em>’ <em>Patris Corde,</em> (8^th^ December 2020) about the Year of St.
Joseph, has said that popular trust in St. Joseph is seen in the
expression, ‘Go to Joseph,’ which evokes the famine in Egypt when the
Egyptians begged Pharaoh for food.</p>

<p>In return, Pharaoh replied, “Go to Joseph and what he says to you, do”
(Gen. 41:55). Pharaoh was referring to Joseph, the son of Jacob, who was
sold into slavery because of the jealousy of his brothers. We've been
reading this story in the Mass in the past few weeks, a very beautiful
story. Joseph, according to the biblical account, subsequently became
the Viceroy of Egypt.</p>

<p>“As a descendant of David (Matt. 1:20), from whom stock Jesus was to
spring according to the promise made to David by the prophet Nathan (cf.
2 Sam. 7), and as the spouse of Mary of Nazareth, St. Joseph stands at
the crossroads between the Old and the New Testaments” (<em>Patris Corde</em>,
para. 1).</p>

<p>We can look again at Joseph, a model of so many virtues.</p>

<p>The Holy Father in his letter ‘<em>With the Father's Heart’</em> talks about
the creative courage of Joseph. A rather beautiful phrase; “he was a
creatively courageous father.”</p>

<p>And, he says, “If the first stage of all true interior healing is to
accept our personal history and embrace even the things in life that we
did not choose, we must now add another important element: creative
courage” (<em>Patris Corde,</em> para. 5).</p>

<p>We all need courage, we need creative courage. We could ask St. Joseph
if we might be able to show the same ‘creative courage’ by facing with
initiative, the challenges of our apostolic tasks—the same ‘creative
courage’ that he showed on so many occasions.</p>

<p>And this creativity and this courage, emerge particularly when we're
faced with difficulties, when we have to think out of the box, relying a
little more on supernatural means than humans, when we've used all the
human.</p>

<p>“In the face of difficulty, we can either give up and walk away, or we
can somehow engage with it” (<em>Patris Corde,</em> para. 5).</p>

<p>When Joseph was faced with all the doors in Bethlehem closed in his
face, he didn't walk away, didn't give up, didn't throw his hat on
the ground, and said, “Well, I'm going home.” He knew there must be a
solution. God must have some other plan here.</p>

<p>St. Josemaría says in his homily, <em>In Joseph's Workshop</em>, “he showed
initiative and responsibility in all that he was asked to do” (Point
40). Faced with difficult problems, he solved difficult situations.</p>

<p>Joseph began to look for a solution. And because he looked for a
solution, he found the stable in Bethlehem, and that was where it was
the will of God for the Christ Child to be born.</p>

<p>“At times,” says the Holy Father, “difficulties bring out resources we
did not even think we had” We grow in the face of difficulties. Maybe
that's sometimes why Our Lord permits the difficulties” (<em>Patris
Corde,</em> para. 5). We need to be stretched to develop our talents.</p>

<p>“As we read the infancy narratives,” he says, “we might often wonder,
why God did not act more directly and clearly. And yet God acts through
events and people. One of those persons at the beginning of the
incarnation was Joseph. Joseph was the man chosen by God to guide the
beginnings of the history of redemption. Chosen from the foundation of
the world. He was the true ‘miracle’ by which God saved the Child and
His mother. God acted by trusting in Joseph's creative courage”
(<em>Patris Corde,</em> para. 5).</p>

<p>He knew he had the talents. Maybe they were hidden, but He wanted to
draw them out.</p>

<p>“Arriving in Bethlehem and finding no lodging where Mary could give
birth, he took a stable and as best he could, turned it into a welcoming
home for the Son of God to come into the world” (<em>Patris Corde,</em> para.
5) as best he could.</p>

<p>I've just been reading a book about the first Archbishop of Nairobi, J.
G. McCarthy. He used to say to his missionary priests, “Do the best you
can” as he sent them out to start a new parish someplace. We're all
asked ‘to do the best we can.’</p>

<p>Joseph did as best he could to turn that cold, inhuman place into a
focal point of warmth and family life for the whole of eternity.</p>

<p>“Faced with imminent danger from Herod, who wanted to kill the Child,
Joseph was once again warned in a dream to protect the Child. And he
rose in the middle of the night to prepare the flight into Egypt.”</p>

<p>Pope Francis says, “A superficial reading of these stories can often
give the impression that the world is at the mercy of the strong and
mighty. But the ‘Good News’ of the Gospel consists in showing that for
all the arrogance and violence of worldly powers, God always finds a way
to carry out His saving plan” (<em>Patris Corde,</em> para. 5)</p>

<p>As we try to think with creative courage of the tasks that God has
placed in front of us, not unlike the tasks He placed in front of St.
Joseph, we could ask him that we might have that same faith, that same
hope, daring, fortitude, courage to bring things forward. Our lives at
times might seem to be at the mercy of the powerful, but the Gospel
shows us what counts.</p>

<p>Another reason why the daily reading of a few words or a few lines from
the Gospel can nourish our soul to a great degree. God always finds a
way to save us, provided that we show the same ‘creative courage’ as the
carpenter of Nazareth, who was able to turn a problem into a possibility
by trusting always in divine providence.</p>

<p>We could ask Joseph for that entrepreneurial spirit to turn problems
into possibilities, to create apostolic opportunities, to spread the
Good News, to spread ideas, to meet people, to influence society, and to
Christianize it.</p>

<p>Because that's the vocation of the layperson, to be immersed in the
middle of the world, to make a splash, to have an influence.</p>

<p>We need all the creativity we can get and we need all the courage we can
get also. If at times it seems that God hasn't helped us, it doesn't
mean that we've been abandoned, but rather we're being trusted to
plan, to be creative, to find solutions ourselves, to work at things, to
hang in there, to persevere. God wants us to use the human means, wants
us to find the answers, that possibly He hides from us in the beginning,
but when we earn them, He will give them to us.</p>

<p>That sort of creative courage was also shown by the friends of the
paralytic. They tried to bring their friend close to Jesus, as we try to
do with all our friends, but they found there were too many people
there. They couldn't get close to the Master.</p>

<p>What did they do? Well, with the enthusiasm of youth, they climbed up
onto the roof and they vandalized the roof. They took off a couple of
tiles, presumably they put them back afterwards. They looked for another
solution, and then they lowered their friend down in front of Our Lord
(cf. Luke 5:17-26).</p>

<p>Difficulties did not stand in the way of those friends. There was
boldness and persistence there. They were convinced that they had to get
their friend to Christ. They were convinced that Jesus could heal the
man.</p>

<p>We’re told, “…finding no way to bring him in because of the crowd,
they went up on the roof and let him down with his bed through the
tiles, into the middle of the crowd in front of Jesus. And when he saw
their faith,” Jesus said, “Friend, your sins are forgiven you” (Luke
5:19-21). Christ saw the faith of these friends, the faith of this man.
It was faith shown in deeds, that produced the results.</p>

<p>“The Gospel doesn't tell us how long Our Lady and St. Joseph remained
in Egypt, but we can imagine that they needed to eat, they needed to
find a home and employment.”</p>

<p>God sent them there, but He didn't give them a credit card. “It
doesn't take too much imagination to fill the details. The Holy Family
had to face concrete problems like every other family, particularly like
so many of the migrants in the world today, refugees, risk their lives
to escape misfortune and hunger” (<em>Patris Corde,</em> para. 5).</p>

<p>The Holy Father wants us to have a special antenna for these people,
these brothers of ours, show them Christian charity, and help our
families to think about these people.</p>

<p>There but for the grace of God, so go I. And how much in need these
people are of a helping hand—somebody to help them to get going again,
to show them a little bit of human hospitality.</p>

<p>The Holy Family in Egypt could be like the patron saint of these sorts
of people. “We can consider St. Joseph,” he says, “the special patron of
all those forced to leave their native lands because of war or hatred,
or persecution, poverty” (<em>Patris Corde,</em> para. 5).</p>

<p>“At the end of every gospel account where Joseph plays a role,” we're
told “that he gets up and takes the child and His mother and does
whatever God commanded him”. It's as though he knows that “Jesus and
Mary, His mother, are the most precious treasures of our faith (<em>Patris
Corde,</em> para. 5). And Our Lord is inseparable from Our Lady.</p>

<p>Jesus was to advance in wisdom and age and grace (cf. Luke 2:52) under
the care of Joseph. And Our Lady was also to advance in what John Paul
II called ‘her pilgrimage of faith’, journeying forward in faith
throughout the course of her life. And “she faithfully persevered in her
union with her Son, even until she stood at the cross” (<em>Patris Corde,</em>
para. 5).</p>

<p>Like Joseph, we could “always consider how are we protecting Our Lord
and Our Lady, because “they also are mysteriously entrusted to our own
responsibility, care and safekeeping” (<em>Patris Corde,</em> para. 5); Blessed
Sacrament, our parish church, our outstation church, the domestic Church
of our home.</p>

<p>The Son of God made man, “came into our world in a state of great
vulnerability”. Vulnerability is a word that comes from the Latin word
<em>vulnera</em>, which means a wound; vulnerability, able to be wounded.</p>

<p>“He needed to be defended, protected, cared for” (<em>Patris Corde,</em> para.
5), embraced by Joseph. He must have learned many, many things, possibly
many that came out later in His preaching, from the mouth of Joseph. God
trusted Joseph, as did Our Lady. “She found in him someone who would not
only save her life but would always provide for her and her Child”
(<em>Patris Corde,</em> para. 5).</p>

<p>We can also think of St. Joseph as the guardian of the Church, because
the Church is the continuation of the Body of Christ in history, the
Mystical Body of Christ. In the same way as Our Lady's motherhood is
reflected in the motherhood of the Church. “Joseph carried out a
continuous protection of the Church. He continues to protect the Child
and His mother” (<em>Patris Corde,</em> para. 5). And we too, by our love for
the Church, continue to love the Child and His mother.</p>

<p>“That Child,” says Pope Francis, “would go on to say, ‘as you did it to
one of these, least of these, who are members of my family, you did it
to me’” (Matt. 25:40). Every poor person, needy person, the person who
may be suffering or dying, or every stranger or prisoner, every sick
child, is the ‘child’ whom Joseph continues to protect. We could try to
take on our shoulders the responsibility of Joseph, how we must feel for
the whole of mankind!</p>

<p>Joseph can be “invoked as the protector of the unfortunate, the needy,
exiles, the afflicted, the poor and the dying. The Church,” says Pope
Francis, “cannot fail to show a special love for the least of our
brothers and sisters, because Jesus showed a particular concern for
them, and personally identified with them” (<em>Patris Corde,</em> para. 5).
“From St. Joseph we learn that same care and responsibility. We can
learn to love the Child and His mother, to love the sacraments and
charity, to love the Church and to love the poor,” because “each of
these realities is always the Child and His mother” (<em>Patris Corde,</em>
para. 5).</p>

<p>Pope Francis entitled his Exhortation, <em>With the Father's Heart</em>. “St.
Joseph did everything with the Father's heart; caring, protecting,
reaching out, being vigilant.</p>

<p>“Each of us,” he says, “can discover in Joseph the man who goes
unnoticed. A daily discreet and hidden presence. An intercessor, a
support and a guide in times of trouble” (cf. <em>Patris Corde,</em> para. 7).
“Joseph,” he says, “reminds us that those who appear hidden are in the
shadows can play an incomparable role in the history of salvation”
(<em>Patris Corde,</em> para. 5).</p>

<p>In the Oscar Awards, sometimes it's not the main actor that receives
the Oscar. There's an Oscar for the best supporting role. And sometimes
it's the main actor who receives the Oscar. There's an Oscar for the
best supporting role. When the curtain goes down at the end of the play,
it doesn't matter who has played the part of the king and who has
played the part of the servant. The important thing is how they've
played their part.</p>

<p>When Joseph truly won an Oscar, he was a beloved father. The spouse of
Our Lady, the foster father of Jesus. he placed himself, as St. John of
Chrysostom says, “at the service of the entire plan of salvation, he was
open to everything. Here I am because you have called me” (<em>Patris
Corde,</em> para. 1).</p>

<p>St. Paul VI says “he made his life a sacrificial service to the mystery
of the Incarnation and its redemptive purpose. He made his life a
sacrificial service to the mystery of the Incarnation and its redemptive
purpose. He devoted himself completely to the Holy Family in his life
and in his work” (<em>Patris Corde,</em> para. 1).</p>

<p>“He turned his human vocation to domestic love,” says Pope Francis,
“into a superhuman sacrifice of himself, of his heart and all his
abilities. A love placed at the service of the Messiah who was growing
to maturity in his home” (<em>Patris Corde,</em> para. 1).</p>

<p>We can turn frequently to St. Joseph in these coming days and months,
asking him that we might be closer to him, seeing aspects of his life
and virtue that we might not have seen before.</p>

<p>Pope Francis refers to him as “a tender and loving father” because he
oversaw the growth of Jesus “who grew in wisdom and age and grace before
God and men” (<em>Patris Corde,</em> para. 2).</p>

<p>The Book of Hosea talks about how Our Lord God had done with Israel, so
Joseph did with Jesus. He taught him to walk, taking by the hand. He was
for Him like a father who raises an infant to his cheeks, bending down
to him and feeding him. And in Joseph Our Lord saw the tender love of
God (cf. Hos. 11:3-4).</p>

<p>We're told in the Psalms: “As a father has compassion for his children,
so the Lord has compassion for those who fear him” (Ps. 103:13).</p>

<p>“In the synagogue, during the praying of the Psalms, (Ps. 145:9) Joseph
must have heard again and again that the God of Israel is a God of
tender love, who is good to all, compassionate over all that he has
made” (<em>Patris Corde,</em> para. 2).</p>

<p>We have many things to learn from the Holy Patriarch. He was an obedient
father, he was a good father. As he had done with Our Lady, God revealed
His saving plan to Joseph using the dreams, which were spoken of in
Scripture. This was the way He made His will well known (cf. Matt. 1:20;
2:13, 19, 22).</p>

<p>Joseph was deeply troubled by Mary's mysterious pregnancy. She
disappears without a word. He's left high and dry. She comes back and
she says nothing. But then with the revelation of the angel, Joseph
comes to know the full story (Matt. 1:20).</p>

<p>How often when we don't know the full story, we could easily be
mistaken in our judgment. And those could be big mistakes. The
importance is always waiting for that bigger picture.</p>

<p>We are told he was a just man, who did not want to expose her to public
disgrace. And he decided to put her away privately (Matt. 1:19). He's
forgetting about himself, his future, his family, and his good name.</p>

<p>He's thinking all the time about Our Lady. How can she be more
comfortable, happy, taken care of? But then the angel appears to him and
says, “Do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife for that which is
conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit” (Matt.1:20).</p>

<p>That must have been the joy of his life, those words. “And she will bear
a son and you will call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from
their sins” (Matt. 2:21).</p>

<p>And as always, Joseph reacted immediately. “He did what the angel of the
Lord had commanded” (Matt. 1:25).</p>

<p>The Holy Father says that Joseph was also an accepting father. He
accepts Mary unconditionally. He's very noble. We're told that “the
nobility of Joseph's heart is such that what he learned from the law he
made dependent on charity” (<em>Patris Corde,</em> para. 4).</p>

<p>Even though Joseph doesn't understand the bigger picture, he makes a
decision to protect Mary's good name, her dignity and her life. This
was real love put into practice. He couldn't have done better.</p>

<p>We can ask St. Joseph in these coming weeks and months to help us to
work a little bit on our creative courage so that we can walk a little
more in his footsteps and bring the great fruit in our life as came from
his life.</p>

<p>And as always, Our Lady and the Child Jesus, when they see us taking out
of the background of our interior life that person who went so far, that
person who meant so much to them in their earthly life, they will also
be very happy.</p>

<p>Mary, help us to get to know your spouse a little better.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and
inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I
ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint
Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
Amen.</em></p>

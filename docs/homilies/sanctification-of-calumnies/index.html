    <h1>Sanctification of Calumnies</h1>
    <p>By Fr. Conor Donnelly</p>

<p><em>(Proofread)</em></p>

<p>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</p>

<p>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful.</p>

<p>My immaculate mother, Saint Joseph, my father and Lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</p>

<p>Happy are those who are persecuted for justice. We're told in St. Peter that if you are reproached for the name of Christ, you are blessed because the spirit of glory and of God rests upon you.</p>

<p>St. Peter also says, “for one is approved if mindful of God, he endures pain while suffering unjustly”(1 Pt, 2:19). “But even if you do suffer for righteousness sake, you will be blessed. Have no fear or be troubled”(1 Pt. 3:14). St. Peter says on another occasion.</p>

<p>And in the beatitudes we're told, “blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. And blessed are you when men revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven. For so men persecuted the prophets who were before you”(Mt. 5:10-12).</p>

<p>These passages also make it clear that the persecution is on my account. It makes it clear that this persecution is for Christ. And as also in the first beatitude, these beatitudes promise the reward of the possession of the kingdom. God's love fully reigning in our lives. What could be more great and more splendid than this?</p>

<p>And so the beatitudes say, happy are you. And so pushed to its extreme, you have here the paradox of the beatitudes, happiness, urging us to rejoice and be glad because there's difficulties that lie at the heart of the humanly most least gratifying of situations, the experience of persecution, of insult, of infamous slander. This is the culmination of the way mapped out by the beatitudes. The summit of the Holy Spirit's work in our lives, a strength to embrace suffering for Christ is a good thing, to welcome the cross as a gift.</p>

<p>And here is the ultimate degree of maturity in spiritual freedom, as well as the most powerful witness human beings can give.</p>

<p>The church has always known persecution, and today it's more prevalent than ever before. This century extending from the Armenian genocide, to the executions carried out by the Islamic State, has witnessed more victims among Christian faithful than the previous 20 centuries combined. An ecumenism of blood is among the marks of the church today.</p>

<p>Persecution can take various forms, the shedding of martyr's blood, social discrimination and restriction, hateful caricatures of Christian faith in the media, the exclusion of religion from the public square, sneers by teachers and schoolmates aimed at a teacher who affirms that he or she is a Christian, misunderstandings and conflicts within families when some member or members attempt to live the Christian vocation, and many others.</p>

<p>Often in Western countries, we see the insidious forms of persecution involving not open persecution, but the defaming and denying of Christian values. To be sure, we need to avoid having a persecuted complex and retreating into a sort of ghetto for protection against the modern world. But that said, it's simply a fact that living in conformity with the gospel values and the teaching of Christ is a challenge today.</p>

<p>Parents are all too aware of this when they are forced to confront the conflict between the worldview and the values they try to transmit to their children, are often those that are on offer at school and in the media. But our Lord clearly announced before all this, they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons, and you will be brought before kings and governors for my name's sake. This will be a time for you to bear testimony.</p>

<p>And he said there should be no surprise at this. A servant is not greater than his master. We see this form of persecution with people praying silently outside abortion clinics, often accused of hateful thoughts going through their mind with no external foundation in reality. But our Lord said, if they persecuted me, they will persecute you. The hour is coming when whoever kills you will think he's offering a service to God.</p>

<p>We can have the figure of the just man persecuted because he's faithful to living and announcing the word of God. The people of God in the Old Testament who suffer for being different, as in the book of Exodus, the book of Esther, the book of the martyrs of Israel. As a characteristic of this persecution, it's a hostility that doesn't have its ultimate source in historic, social, political, or other causes, but rather in hatred of God, an attempt by the devil to destroy God's plan by attacking his children.</p>

<p>And so quoting the Psalms, our Lord says, “he who hates me hates my Father also. If I had not done among you, among them, the works which no one else did, they would not have sinned. But now they have seen and hated both and my Father. It is to fulfill the word that is written in their law, they hated me without a cause”(Jn. 15:23-25).</p>

<p>The result is not just a record of human misfortunes, but the manifestation of a ferocious struggle between the mystery of evil and God's providential plans. The devil opposes the election of Israel and the founding of the church, as he does all other expressions of divine mercy that work to accomplish salvation. Hatred of Israel, like hatred of Christians, has some human explanations, but those fail to account for it. Its deepest roots are in the spiritual realm, in hostility towards God and his creative and redeeming work. In some countries, Christian couples are prevented from adopting children because they are Christians.</p>

<p>And this hostility is described early in the Psalms. He says, “the kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers take counsel together against the Lord and against his anointed” (Pslm. 2:2).</p>

<p>In the book Acts of the Apostles, it says, ‘“the place in which they were gathered together was shaken. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God with boldness. This accounts, refer to one of the first persecutions, and the people turn to trust in God. The Holy Spirit came to the aid of those suffering for His kingdom” (Act. 4:31).</p>

<p>In the Old Testament, the figure of the prophet or the just man who was persecuted, becoming an object of hostility and hatred by all, because he belongs to God and proclaims God's words, finds its deepest expression in the passages of Isaiah that concern the servant. That servant signifies both the people and an individual, and brings an extraordinary message of hope.</p>

<p>In Isaiah, we're told the suffering of the just will be the source of holiness for all, including those who so frantically oppose him. He makes himself an offering for sin. He shall bear their iniquities. The prophet Zechariah says the death of the just opens up a source of grace and conversion. On that day we're told there should be a fountain opened for the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to cleanse them from sin and uncleanness.</p>

<p>The suffering of the just culminating in the cross of Christ is a scandal, and it's a mysterious part of the history of salvation and also God's plan. It's both judgment and salvation, a highlighting of human sin and a source of healing from sin.</p>

<p>The New Testament tells us that the prospect of persecution, far from being a cause of worry or sadness, should be a source of trust in the faithfulness and help of God, and even joy, because of the closeness to Christ it fosters and the future reward it helps to bring about.</p>

<p>And so St. James says, "Count it all joy, my brethren, when you meet various trials."(Jm 1:2) And St. Peter says, "Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal which comes upon you to prove you as though something strange were happening to you. But rejoice insofar as you share Christ's sufferings, that you may also rejoice and be glad when His glory is revealed. If you are reproached for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the spirit of glory and of God rests upon you. And let none of you suffer as a murderer or a thief or a wrongdoer or a mischief maker. Yet if one suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but under that name, let him glorify God."(1 Pt. 4:12-16)</p>

<p>And how is it that persecution and the acceptance of martyrdom in particular is a grace? Well firstly because it's something like a fire that purifies. It requires a decision, a radical and definitive rupture with the world of sin, and enables the one who suffers to enter directly into the holiness of God. St. Peter says, “since therefore Christ suffered in the flesh, arm yourself with the same thought, for whoever has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin” (1 Pt. 4:1-2).</p>

<p>In the new covenant as in the old, martyrdom is a way of fulfilling the gracious commandment. “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your might” (Dt. 6:5). This participation in Christ's sufferings brings to fulfillment the most ardent faith, hope and charity. To accept martyrdom, witnesses to complete faith in God's faithfulness. It forcefully manifests hope in the resurrection of the body and eternal life. And is the highest expression of love for someone to love God more than his or her own life.</p>

<p>And so this is the greatest act of love of God and neighbor that anyone can make. "Greater love has no man than this," we're told in St. John, "that a man lay down his life for his friends" (Jn. 15:13) And this is the ultimate expression of love that we see in Christ. Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end. And so the incarnation and the passion of Christ show how much God loves us, and the acceptance of martyrdom shows how humankind through the grace of Christ are capable of loving God.</p>

<p>Around Christmas time, we see there's a striking change in the color of the vestments from the white of the vestments of Christmas Day, we move to the red of the feast of St. Stephen the following day. Just a day after the joyful feast of the birth of our Lord that celebrates God becoming one of us out of love, we celebrate the feast of the first martyr. God gave himself entirely to us so that we can completely give ourselves to him. He loves us without measure, so that we can love him without measure, even more than our own lives.</p>

<p>Martyrdom is also a supreme act of love of neighbor. The Christian martyr forgives, prays for those who make him or her suffer, and offers his or her life for their salvation. The Holy Spirit is present in those who suffer for Jesus, giving them strength and manifesting itself in the words of wisdom, the prophecies and the vision that often accompanied the moment of martyrdom. The martyr carries love of enemies as far as it can go, as the gospel urges to be done.</p>

<p>But martyrdom is not an expression of personal heroism or greatness. It's a witness to the power of God active within human weakness. The preface for the mass of the martyrs says so. It says for the blood of your blessed martyr poured out like Christ to glorify your name shows forth your marvelous works by which in our weakness you perfect your power and on the feeble bestow strength to bear your witness through Christ our Lord.</p>

<p>What explains the beauty and the grace of the martyr, the goodness hidden, is the depth of communion with God. This is what led Saint Ignatius of Antioch on his way to martyrdom to say in his letter to the Romans, "Let me be the food of the animals through which it will be possible for me to find God."</p>

<p>To suffer martyrdom makes it certain that one will enter the house of the Father forever. There within me, a water that lives and speaks, saying to me inwardly, "Come to the Father." We say something similar in the mass, through Him, in Him, through Him, with Him, in Him. Each martyrdom reproduces the passion of Christ. St. Felicity, arrested in Carthage in the year 2002, gave birth to a child in prison just before her martyrdom. To the jailer who said to her, "If you're groaning now, what will you do when you're exposed to the beasts?" She replied, "I'm the one who suffers now, but then there will be another in me who will suffer for me, because it is for him that I will be suffering."</p>

<p>Martyrdom is the occasion of our most powerful experience of the Spirit's help. St. Peter said, “if you are reproached for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the spirit of glory and of God rests in you” (1 Pt. 4:14).</p>

<p>The stories of the martyrs in the first centuries highlight the charismatic aspect of martyrdom. We're told in the Acts about St. Stephen, he, “full of the Holy Spirit, gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. And he said, behold, I see the heavens opened and the son of man standing at the right hand of God” (Act. 7:55-56).</p>

<p>And so the Beatitudes tell us that we must be ready. Our Lord says, "Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour." He says, "Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak" (Mt. 26:41). Given the modern means of persecution, there's no truly safe place. We might be called on to die for the faith at any time or any place. But most of us are called to live for the faith, put up with persecution in different ways, in the ordinary circumstances where we live.</p>

<p>This doesn't mean that we should live in constant fear. We're told in scripture “the Holy Spirit will be given to us when the time comes to say what needs to be said” (Lk. 12:11-12). But we need to do is faithfully live our Christian vocation, persevere in prayer, and remain in union with Christ above all.</p>

<p>There was a story of a university student in Brazil who in a class one day heard a teacher saying something that was not quite the teaching of the church, a little bit off, a little bit negative. And so wanting to live out his Christian vocation, put up his hand and tried to put the teacher right in a certain way, politely, clearly, but briefly. But the teacher reacted rather negatively and said, you've come and see me after class. And so the student was a bit disappointed, also a bit worried. Thought maybe the teacher will throw me out of the class, maybe I won't be able to finish my degree, maybe I won't be able to practice my profession, began to see all sorts of doomsday scenarios. And then remembered the phrase from scripture that says you will be called before governors and princes on my account, but do not worry what you are to say, I will place on your lips what needs to be said.</p>

<p>And so the student began to complain to God, you said you'd put on our lips in these situations what needs to be said. And now look at the mess I'm in. I should have kept my big mouth shut. But anyway, he went along to the office of the teacher after the class, knocked on the door, and the teacher said, "Come in." And the teacher asked, "Where did you learn those ideas that you were stating just now in the class?" And so very apologetically, the student tried to say, "Well, you see, the last couple of years I've been going to this center of Opus Dei downtown and I think I might have picked up some of those ideas there." And the teacher said, "Well, keep going to that place." The student was a bit surprised, “keep going to that place, but you seem to be saying the very opposite there in the class”. And the teacher said, "Yes," he said, "because when I was your age, I used to go to that place. And they were trying to get me to change my life. But I didn't have the courage or the generosity to do so. And ever since then, I've spent half my life saying stupid things and the other half trying to justify what I was saying."</p>

<p>And so the student came out of the teacher's office, lifting up his heart to the Holy Spirit, saying, “thank you, Holy Spirit. Thank you, Holy Spirit”.</p>

<p>This reality of persecution or calumnies that we might have to suffer can lead us to pray for people who may be in situations of suffering. We could be mindful of all the people who have suffered for the faith in the communist countries during the 20th century. We have yet to find out or know a lot of details. We know some things, but we don't know everything. Maybe it will be written in the coming years and decades. We benefit very much from the sacrifice of those who have suffered in different ways. And we have a duty to help those who may be suffering some form of persecution by praying for them. Nowadays, it may not be so much in communist countries, it might be in ordinary common or [garden]{.mark} <strong>(at mark 24:44 in audio)</strong> [professional]{.mark} organizations, schools, and hospitals.</p>

<p>We're told by St. Paul, if one member of the body suffers, all the members share in the suffering. We also need to accept the fact that Christian life is a combat, a struggle to be faithful, to resist temptation, to undergo continuing conversion, to serve God and proclaim the gospel in a variety of ways. Most of us never got our head chopped off for Christ. If on some occasion in our student or professional life we have to suffer a little bit for Christian values or to promote gospel values or to raise our voice in defense of things that are good, or write a letter to the newspaper or to email or something. Well, this is just part of our Christian vocation, basic matters of ordinary administration. St. Paul tells Timothy, "Take your share of suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus." (2 Ti 2:3)</p>

<p>And everyone who does so is aware that many difficulties can plague any attempt to announce the word of God. There can be material problems, there can be interior anguish and fatigue, there can be temptations of all sorts. There can be a spiritual cost. But without seeing spiritual welfare everywhere, it's a fact that something besides human causes are at work in the vicissitudes of life in the service of Christ. Often things don't work out the first time or the second time. It may take a third time and the passage of a good year of time before things happen.</p>

<p>I was reading a book once about the, it was a doctoral thesis that was written in Oxford. It was about the spread of the early Christian schools in the Malaysian peninsula. The La Salle brothers arrived in Penang in the late of 1800s, mid to late 1800s, to start the school. They had to compete with the British government schools. It took 50 years before they could compete with them in any sort of significant way. But after that, they overtook the British government schools. And those La Salle schools throughout the Malaysian peninsula became the best schools in the countries of Malaysia and of Singapore for the next 100 years.</p>

<p>And so everything works out for the good. People who don't believe in the devil may be people who have never lived or preached the gospel seriously. St. Paul says, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might. Put on the armor of God that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we are not contending against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against the powers, against world rulers of this present darkness, against the spiritual host of wickedness in the heavenly places. Therefore, take the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all, to stand.</p>

<p>We shouldn't be frightened by when we see the devil's hand in everything. That would be giving him too much credit to think that he's everywhere. But at the same time, we should be realistic about the war that the church is fighting and trust God's promises with absolute confidence.</p>

<p>St. Paul told Titus that the heart of the combat is the good fight of the faith. St. Teresa of Avila in her prayer used to say, I want to love you like a little child. I want to fight like a brave warrior. The two are not incompatible.</p>

<p>Part and parcel of all of this of our struggle is that sometimes we're going to be treated unfairly. People may say untrue things. There may be all sorts of calumnies. And while we need to resist all forms of injustice and we're entitled to claim and defend our rights, St. Paul did so, we shouldn't expect to be always treated as we would deserve to be treated.</p>

<p>St. Peter told Christian slaves that they had to bear patiently with injustice in love and imitation of Christ, that this was sometimes part of their vocation. He says, "For one is approved if mindful of God he endures pain while suffering unjustly. For what credit is it if when you do wrong and are beaten, beaten for it, you take it patiently? But if when you do right and suffer for it, you take it patiently, you have God's approval. For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example that you should follow in his in his footsteps. When he was reviled, he did not revile in return. When he suffered, he did not threaten, but he trusted in him who judges justly. He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wound, you have been healed, for you were straying like sheep, but have now returned to the shepherd and guardian of your souls." (1 Pt. 20-25)</p>

<p>And so sometimes we should defend ourselves. It may be necessary and obligatory to do so. Sometimes we have to submit to injustice out of love for Christ. If we were always to be demanded that we would be treated with perfect justice, we might end up by being unjust towards others. It's better to submit to evil than to commit it.</p>

<p>And our great consolation can always be in Our Lady, entrusting ourselves to her. She is our most powerful and effective help in spiritual combat. Her heart is a haven of peace and hope for all who take refuge in her. Her intercession is powerful before God. Her presence and support are of an immense assistance to us in the struggles and temptations that we face. Her maternal tenderness is a sweet consolation in our trials. Her faith, her humility, and the purity of her love make her unassailable.</p>

<p>Our Lady lived each of the beatitudes perfectly, and she helps us understand and practice them effectively. If we give ourselves entirely to her, she will give herself entirely to us and share with us the riches that she has received from God. Through her we'll become poor in heart, humble and meek. In her arms we'll be consoled. She will make us hungry and thirsty for God. She'll make us good and merciful. She will share with us the purity of her heart. She will establish us in a profound peace to be shared with those around us. She'll give us the grace of being strong in the combat and able to embrace the cross as a grace. And Our Lady will open wide the gates of the kingdom and of true happiness for each one of us.</p>

<p>I thank you my God for the good resolutions, affections, and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice. My immaculate mother, St. Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me. In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</p>

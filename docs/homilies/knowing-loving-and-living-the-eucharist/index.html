    <h1>Knowing, Loving, and Living the Eucharist</h1>
    <p>By Fr. Conor Donnelly</p>

<p><em>(Proofread)</em></p>

<p>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen.</p>

<p>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me,
that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon
for my sins, and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My
Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my Guardian Angel,
intercede for me.</p>

<p><strong>Looking up, Jesus saw the crowds approaching, and said to Philip,
“Where can we buy some bread for these people to eat?”</strong></p>

<p><strong>He said this only to put Philip to the test. He knew exactly what he
was going to do. Philip answered, “200 denarii would not buy enough to
give them a little piece each.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>One of the disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said, “Here is a
small boy with five barley loaves and two fish, but what is that among
so many?”</strong></p>

<p>Several years ago, a professor of Scripture came to Dublin from Rome and
went to visit a library there, sort of a museum library, that has some
of the oldest pieces of papyri in the whole world and one of the pieces
that they have is the oldest piece of the Gospel of Saint John, Chapter
One. They don't get too many visitors and this professor of Scripture
was very excited about seeing these heirlooms, wonderful antiques when
the caretaker saw the enthusiasm of this professor of Scripture, he
opened the glass case and allowed the professor to hold this piece of
papyrus in his hand.</p>

<p>I heard that professor, waxing eloquently, about this wonderful
experience of holding this very sacred and holy and ancient piece of
Scripture in his hands, and of course, all of that was very real and
very understandable. But when you compare holding that piece of papyrus
from the first century in your hands to holding the sacred host or to
having that sacred host in our mouth, inside our body, the real presence
of Christ, body and blood, whole and entire, soul and divinity, there's
no comparison.</p>

<p>Saint Pius X said, “Devotion to the Eucharist is the noblest of
devotions because it has God as its object. It is the most profitable
for salvation because it gives us the author of grace. It is the
sweetest because the Lord is sweetness itself.”</p>

<p>Saint Thomas Aquinas likes to say that the “Blessed Eucharist is the
most perfect of all the sacraments because all the sacraments transmit
grace but the Blessed Eucharist, in the Blessed Eucharist, we receive
the author of grace.” It is on a different level.</p>

<p>Only God can work the transformation of the transubstantiation, whereby
the substance of the bread and wine is changed into the substance of the
body and blood of Our Lord Jesus Christ. He does this according to His
ways, which Saint Paul says, <strong>those who count for nothing, to reduce to
nothing those who are something.</strong></p>

<p>It's all due to him, to his divine and infinite power. And with that
power He allows an almighty force of attraction to radiate from every
tabernacle, reaching souls through the ministry of the priest.</p>

<p>Each priest is like a minister of the Tabernacle. Saint Paul refers to
priests in his letters to the Corinthians as the <strong>dispensers of the
mysteries of God.</strong></p>

<p>And the Eucharistic Jesus, present in the sacred host, is a true
Emmanuel, a true God with us. We could ask Our Lord in this octave of
the feast of the body and blood of Our Lord Jesus Christ, of Corpus
Christi, to help us to penetrate a little deeper into this great
Eucharistic mystery.</p>

<p>Pope Pius XII said, “The faith of the Church is this, that one and
identical is the Word of God and the Son of Mary who suffered on the
cross, who is present in the Eucharist and who rules in heaven.”</p>

<p>The Eucharistic Jesus is here with us, as a brother, as a friend, and as
a spouse of our souls. He wishes to enter within us, to be our food for
eternal life. <strong>He who eats my body and drinks my blood, I will live in
him and I will raise him on the last day.</strong></p>

<p>Our Lord wants to make us part of his mystical body, in which He would
redeem us and save us and then take us into the kingdom of heaven, the
eternal wedding feast, to settle us in an everlasting bliss of love.</p>

<p>With the Blessed Eucharist, God has truly given us everything. St.
Augustine exclaimed, “Although God is all-powerful, He is unable to give
more. Though supremely wise, He knows not how to give more. Though
vastly rich, He has not more to give.”</p>

<p>St. Peter Julian Emeyard, a great saint of the Blessed Sacrament, and
founder of the Blessed Sacrament Fathers, said that “You will find all
the help and comfort and graces you need in the Eucharist. You'll find
the warm words you want to hear. The knowledge and the miracles you
need. Yes, even the miracles.”</p>

<p>To the Blessed Eucharist then we should go. We should turn to Jesus, who
wishes to make himself ours to make us His by rendering us godlike.</p>

<p>Jesus is the food of strong souls. I know a saint used to pray,
strengthen me, purify me, and make me godlike.</p>

<p>We could ask Our Lord that we might receive the Blessed Sacrament with a
pure and ardent heart because that's how the saints received Our Lord.
It should never be too much trouble for us to grow familiar with this
unspeakable mystery, meditating on the words that the saints have left
us, or that the Church teaches us. Meditation, study, and reflection on
the Eucharist should have an important place in our spiritual life.</p>

<p>St. Matthew says “The Eucharist is the heavenly leaven, which is capable
of fermenting in the human nature of every person all spiritual and
temporal goods.”</p>

<p>If we realize the great treasures that are hidden in the Eucharist, that
are available for us, we'll make it a priority to receive the Blessed
Sacrament as often as we can.</p>

<p>Some saints have said it's so great a good itself that one cannot
desire anything else greater. What could one desire when within oneself
one has Jesus, living and real, the God-made man, the Word-made-flesh,
and blood, for our salvation and happiness?</p>

<p>One of the words that occurs quite frequently in the Gospel is the word
treasure. Our Christian vocation should lead us to have a sense of
treasure.</p>

<p>We're told about the man who discovered a treasure in a field and he
went off and sold all that he had and bought that field. We're told
about the pearl of great price that was worth everything. I can ask Our
Lord for the grace to discover the treasures that are in the Blessed
Sacrament, the treasures of love so that all the other material
treasures that this world might have to offer us might seem very small
in comparison.</p>

<p>On his deathbed, St. Peter Julian Emeyard was asked by one of his
religious sons for some final words for reflection. He said, “I have
nothing more to tell you. You already have the Eucharist. What more do
you want?”</p>

<p>The Church, in trying to foster our Eucharistic piety, has always
encouraged us to take very good care of the Blessed Sacrament. The last
encyclical of St. John Paul II was all about the care in every church
that should be taken for the Real Presence of Our Lord, the sanctuary
lamp, the liturgical items that are used, the flowers on the altar, how
to do different things, how to take care of that Eucharistic piety, so
that every child in the parish learns those lessons they enter through
the eyes.</p>

<p>St. Peter Julian says, “When a spark of the Eucharist is placed in a
soul, a divine germ of life and all the virtues is cast into that heart.
That germ is sufficient of itself to do much.”</p>

<p>One of the great aspects of formation is we try to give young people
from the earliest of ages, in preparing for First Communion and earlier,
that sense of reverence for the Blessed Eucharist. We try to foster that
that soul would become aware of the immense riches stored up in the
mystery of the Eucharist, the treasures, so that that childlike soul
might want those treasures, employing their mind and their heart their
will.</p>

<p>Every time a child enters a chapel or a church, it learns to genuflect,
an act of recognition that our God is there in the Tabernacle. And
little by little the child might come to know more things about that
presence of Our Lord.</p>

<p>If we knew the gifts of our God who is love, and who gives himself to us
as a gift full of love, our lives might be very different. St. Bernard
said, “The Eucharist is that love which surpasses all loves in heaven
and on earth.”</p>

<p>St. Thomas Aquinas said, “The Eucharist is the sacrament of love. It
signifies love, it produces love.” It's the supreme proof of the love
of Jesus.</p>

<p>One day an Arabian prince was passing through a street of Marseilles in
the south of France with a French official and they saw a priest who was
carrying the Blessed Sacrament to a dying man. The French official
stopped, uncovered his head, and knelt. And his friend asked him the
reason for that gesture. The good official said, “I adore my God whom
the priest is carrying to a sick person.”</p>

<p>“How is it possible,” the prince said, “for you to believe that God who
is so great makes himself so little and lets himself go even to the
homes of the poor? We, followers of Islam, have a much higher idea of
God.” The official answered, “It's because you have only an idea of the
greatness of God, but you do not know His love.”</p>

<p>One saint says, “The Eucharist is the supreme proof of the love of
Jesus.” After this, there's nothing more but heaven itself. Our Lord
wants us to learn how to discover the vast extent of the love contained
in the Eucharist and to explore the riches of the Eucharist we use the
heart. St Paul says to the Corinthians <strong>if any man loves not our Lord
Jesus Christ, let him be anathema.</strong></p>

<p>Love for the Eucharist has to spring from our hearts and be always alive
in each one of us. The heart needs to be exercised to love the true God,
and to long for the author of life, as the Acts of the Apostles refer to
Him.</p>

<p>All the saints have encouraged us to say to Our Lord, really, truly, and
substantially present, Jesus I love you. Increase my love. Teach me how
to love. Help me to make little acts of love each day so that I remind
myself, don't let myself forget that you are present there.</p>

<p>The loftiest point of that exercise of love is to receive Our Lord in
Holy Communion. One saint said, “I can no longer avoid thinking of how
in the wonderful greatness of His love, Jesus makes himself perceptible
and shows Himself to his lowliest creature in all the splendors of His
heart.”</p>

<p>When St Therese of Lisieux had become quite ill, she dragged herself
with great effort to church to receive Jesus. And one morning, after
Holy Communion, she was in her cell exhausted and one of the sisters
remarked that she shouldn't exert herself so much. And she said, “Oh,
what are these sufferings to me?”</p>

<p>In comparison with one daily Holy Communion, she was in her cell
exhausted. And one day, after the daily Holy Communion, it was something
that daily communion was not permitted much in our times. She pleaded
with our Lord, “Remain with me as you do in the Tabernacle. Do not ever
withdraw your presence from your little host.”</p>

<p>There's a church document called M<em>ane nobiscum Domine</em> - Stay With Us
Lord. It's the words of the disciples on the road to Emmaus when Our
Lord was about to depart. Words that are relevant for those moments
after Mass when we have Our Lord present in our souls.</p>

<p>St Margaret Mary liked to say “All for the Eucharist, nothing for me.”
She had a burning love for the Blessed Sacrament and when she wasn't
able to receive Holy Communion, she broke out in ardent expressions of
love. “I have such a desire,” she said, “for Holy Communion, that if I
had to walk barefoot along a path of fire to obtain it, I would do so
with unspeakable joy.”</p>

<p>St Catherine of Siena said to her confessor one day, “Father, I am
hungry. For the love of God, give this soul her food, her Lord in the
Eucharist.”</p>

<p>She also confided, “When I'm not able to receive my Lord. I go into the
church and there I look at him. I look at him again. And this satisfies
me.”</p>

<p>During her long and painful illness, St Bernadette of Lourdes expressed
the happiness that she felt in times of sleeplessness because she was
then able to unite herself with Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament.</p>

<p>This was a true exercise of the heart and we can also exercise our will
by bringing the divine lessons of the Eucharist into our life.</p>

<p>We receive the Blessed Sacrament, the infinite worth that is there. It’s
a wonderful thing to ponder it and to seek to love our Lord at Communion
time but we also have to proceed to live it, to live out our priestly
soul, part of the common or universal priesthood of the faithful that
the Second Vatican Council speaks about.</p>

<p>Because the Blessed Sacrament teaches us a love that goes beyond
telling. It speaks to us of total self-sacrifice. There's an unequaled
lesson in humility and self-effacement. Immensely relevant for our lives
in the middle of the world, in marriage, in the family, in the
workplace, on the sports field. In social relations.</p>

<p>The Eucharist teaches us patience and unrestricted dedication. Our Lord
doesn't give up on us, doesn't get fed up, doesn't go away. He's
always there for us. We have to see how Our Lord loved us and still
loves us with great generosity even to the end.</p>

<p><strong>Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the
end.</strong> The whole story of the Last Supper in St John starts with these
beautiful words of love.</p>

<p>When we feel weak and frail, we turn to him to speak to Him, and not
just to ask for His help and support because we already know when He
told us, <strong>without Him you can do nothing.</strong> And with the Eucharist,
we're capable of everything.</p>

<p>But He also wants to obtain what would amaze and move us, our
identification with Him. St Augustine says “It's not a case of us
transforming Christ into ourselves, as we commonly do with food but Our
Lord transforms us into Himself.”</p>

<p>And as our Lord is there all the time in the Blessed Sacrament, it's
logical that we would have a desire to visit Him.</p>

<p>Our Lord said, <strong>Come to me, all you who labor and are heavy burdened,
and I will give you rest.</strong></p>

<p>All the saints have recommended frequent visits to the Blessed
Sacrament, at least daily. It's something to try and achieve apart from
the reception of our Lord in the Mass.</p>

<p>In all of the times that Our Lady has appeared in the last 200 years,
she's always mentioned how much joy her Son gets from the little visits
that people make to Him in the Tabernacle.</p>

<p>We can make it our business to try and pass by a church in the ordinary
moments of the day, on our way to do some shopping, on our way to work,
on our way home, or in other odd moments. And also finding reasons when
we're going with the family by car someplace, to also pass by a church.
To make that visit a part of our journey on that particular day and in
the whole of our life. And that way we foster the Eucharistic piety of
children.</p>

<p>The saints were constantly eager to make visits to Our Lord in the
Blessed Sacrament. Also at times to make holy hours of adoration.</p>

<p>In some churches, they have perpetual adoration where Our Lord is
exposed 24-7 in the monstrance. It's a very good thing if children grow
to be aware of these realities. Or when we can't go physically, or to
make spiritual communions. Our little aspirations are earnest acts of
love that come from the heart.</p>

<p>We gain an awful lot by that practice - we gain much profit.</p>

<p>St John Chrysostom says, “How can we make our bodies a host?” He said,
“Let your eyes look at nothing evil, and you've offered a sacrifice.
Let not your tongue speak unbecoming words, and you have an offering.
Let not your hand sin, and you've offered a holocaust.”</p>

<p>We could think of the edifying reserve of the saints in speaking; how
they controlled their tongue well which had, in a certain sense, been
consecrated by contact with the body of Jesus.</p>

<p>We look back on church history, we can see all the good that souls who
have been filled with the love imparted by the Eucharist have
accomplished because Jesus communicated to them His sentiments of love
for all our fellow men, especially those most in need.</p>

<p>The power of a father of a family, of a mother of a family, who tries to
live out this presence of Christ in their soul and their heart each day,
as they go about their daily chores.</p>

<p>We can think of all the great good that the supernatural families of the
Church have accomplished in education and health care which can't just
have been accomplished with degrees or with the construction of schools
or with money, but rather with the Christ-like spirit that they had in
their heart.</p>

<p>St Francis de Sales encourages every soul to approach the Eucharist as
much as possible because, by adoring and partaking of His beauty, His
goodness, and His purity in this divine sacrament, he says “You will
become all beautiful, good, and pure.”</p>

<p>Saint Josemaria says “Your communions were very cold, you paid little
attention to the Lord, you were distracted by the smallest trifle. But
ever since you began to realize during an intimate dialogue with God
that the angels are present, your attitude has changed. You say to
yourself, ‘Let them not see me like this’ and see how as a result of
thinking, ‘What will they say?” this time for a good motive, you've
advanced a little towards love.”</p>

<p>It can be useful to think of the presence of the angels that surround
the Tabernacle, or that are present in the Mass, or of our guardian
angel as he leads us to receive the Blessed Sacrament, or of how he and
other angels are present around us in those moments of thanksgiving when
Christ is sacramentally present in our body.</p>

<p>In The Furrow, number 684, Saint Josemaria says, “This is my body …”
and the immolation of Jesus took place, hidden unto the appearance of
the bread. He is now there with His flesh, with His blood, with His
soul, and with His divinity. He is the same as on that day when Thomas
placed his fingers in his glorious wounds. And yet on so many occasions,
you saunter by, giving not even a hint of greeting, out of simple good
manners that you would give to any person you knew when you met him. -
You have much less faith than Thomas.”</p>

<p>In another place in The Furrow 685, he says, “If to gain for you your
liberty, a close friend of yours had gone to prison, would you not try
to visit him, to talk to him for a while, to take him some present,
console him, and show him the warmth of your friendship….? And if that
conversation with the prisoner were to save you from some evil and do
you good, would you go without it? And if instead of a friend it was to
be your father or your brother, what then?”</p>

<p>From the contemplation of these ideas, we can learn to have a greater
reverence for Our Lord and the Blessed Sacrament. And use the graces
these days to grow in our Eucharistic piety, and to savour this feast of
the Body and Blood of Our Lord Jesus Christ that the Church has given
us.</p>

<p>The Eucharist was instituted on Holy Thursday, but Holy Thursday is
overshadowed by the other events of Holy Week. The Church wanted to
institute another feast day, and an octave, whereby we could focus more
specifically on that real presence of Our Lord, and come to love Him a
little more, as He so deserves.</p>

<p>John Paul II liked to talk a lot about Our Lady as the Woman of the
Eucharist. He liked to think, and he refers to this in his encyclical,
The Church of the Eucharist, of how Our Lady would have received Holy
Communion from the hands of St John after the death of Our Lord. How
fervent those Communions would have been. It would have been like a
repeat of the Annunciation when Mary received the Body of Christ into
her body.</p>

<p>We could ask Our Lady to accompany us, to teach us to have more
Eucharistic piety, that it can be reflected in all sorts of little
details so that we learn very much from all the great things the saints
have taught us.</p>

<p>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and
inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I
ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, St
Joseph, my father and lord, my Guardian Angel, intercede for me.</p>

<p>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen.<br />

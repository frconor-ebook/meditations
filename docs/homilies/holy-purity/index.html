    <h1>Holy Purity</h1>
    <p>By Fr. Conor Donnelly</p>

<p>(<em>Proofread</em>)</p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see
me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your
pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My
Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel,
intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>If you go to the end of a runway some time and watch the planes taking
off, it can be a very impressive sight. You might wonder how all that
metal gets up into the air, all that weight, tons and tons.</p>

<p>Two or three hundred people, two or three hundred suitcases weighing 23
kilos, all the petrol that's needed, so many things. And yet every time
the plane goes up, at a particular point, you find the plane lifts off
the ground.</p>

<p>You might wonder, what is it that makes it go up? You might think of the
engines, but if it was just for the engines, the plane might just keep
going straight at the end of the runway.</p>

<p>Engineers tell us that what makes the plane fly are the wings. When it
gets to a certain speed, the only way it can go is up, because of the
aerodynamics. And so, nothing on this planet flies without wings.</p>

<p>Some spiritual writers have said that God wants our souls to fly and the
virtue that gives us wings to be able to fly is the virtue of purity.</p>

<p>Purity is the virtue whereby we control our sexual appetite about all
the senses: eyes, ears, touch, etc. Chastity is the virtue whereby the
sexual act is performed as God and nature intended, within marriage and
without any unnatural actions. Modesty is the virtue whereby we respect
our own bodies and those of other people.</p>

<p>When our first parents were in the Garden of Paradise, they had the gift
of rectitude. Their passions were perfectly subject to their reason,
which was perfectly subject to God.</p>

<p>They didn't have any trouble living the virtues of purity, chastity,
and modesty. They were naked without shame.</p>

<p>But then after they committed the original sin, they lost that gift, and
they began to be what Pope St. John Paul II called a shameful nudity
(cf. John Paul II, <em>General Audiences</em>, December 12, 1979 and January
30, 1980).</p>

<p>Ever since then, men have had to struggle to put an order in their
passions, to struggle with that effort to love in the right way. The
devil has messed up the whole notion of human love.</p>

<p>But our Church has the truth, a great truth. In each successive
generation, our Church reveals that truth about human sexuality, about
human love, about the family, about marriage, to successive generations.</p>

<p>If we are to love in the right way, we need to struggle to control our
passions. That takes a human effort and a supernatural effort.</p>

<p>Modern culture might try to tell us that by trying to control our
passions we become nuts. ‘You have to be irrational to be chaste.’ But
we know that's not the reality.</p>

<p>‘People who are pure and chaste, there's something wrong with them.’
Quite the opposite. It's a very normal phenomenon that we try to
control our passions.</p>

<p>If somebody loses their temper and wants to throw a brick through the
window, their parent or their spouse or somebody will tell them to put
that brick down immediately and control themselves.</p>

<p>Part of being a human person involves control, self-mastery,
self-control. We don't hear these words very frequently nowadays—to
control the body in order to allow the soul to breathe, in order to
allow that soul to fly to the heights of an eagle, or to look down on
the world in the way that God looks down on the world.</p>

<p>“Blessed are the clean of heart, for they shall see God” (Matt. 5:8),
not just in the next life, but in all the little aspects of this life,
because “there is something divine hidden in the most ordinary human
reality, and it's up to each one of us to discover it” (Josemaría
Escrivá, <em>Conversations</em>, Point 114).</p>

<p>We have to try and work on the cleanliness of our heart and the
cleanliness of our vision. Many bad things enter the heart through the
eyes.</p>

<p>All the saints talk about the guard of the eyes, not allowing our eyes
to focus on all sorts of wrong things that give us wrong ideas.</p>

<p>We have to try and control our imagination. Again, that word, control.</p>

<p>I met a tea taster in Mombasa once. I'd never met a man whose
profession was a tea taster. There's a big tea market there, one of the
world's tea markets.</p>

<p>He told me that his job was to taste tea all day. And I thought, My
mother, I think, would have loved that job!</p>

<p>I was thinking afterwards, he must have to be very careful with his
taste buds. His whole professional life depends on his taste buds, and
the sensitivity of those taste buds to be able to determine quality tea,
and to identify teas that come from different parts of the country,
which have to go to different parts of the world.</p>

<p>And on his taste buds depends the price he's going to put on that tea,
and his credibility and reputation, and a whole pile of other things.</p>

<p>After the fifth sip of tea, if he gets a bit tired one Monday morning
and decides to have a few whiskeys and a few brandies or to smoke a
cigar, that might interfere with the chemical sensitivity of his taste
buds. They could be contaminated by things that make them lose their
specificity.</p>

<p>Well, likewise, with the taste buds of our soul. We have to try and be
careful that we don't expose our souls to bad things—bad pictures,
bad ideas, or bad conversations. We have to guard those senses in all
sorts of ways.</p>

<p>As each one of us is different, we may find that we have to guard our
senses in ways that maybe other people don't.</p>

<p>We are perhaps sensitive in certain situations. So, we have to know
ourselves and distance ourselves from those people, places, environments
that could be problematic for us.</p>

<p>An “occasion of sin” is any external circumstance that can lead us into
sin. We have to stay away from those sorts of places.</p>

<p>In Ireland many years ago there was a bit of a civil war up in the north
of the country. People used to talk about “no-go areas.” The two
factions that were fighting—it was clear that there were certain areas
of the city that you just did not wander into. You just did not go
there. There was no debate, no discussion. It was just a “no-go area.”</p>

<p>Each of us has no-go areas. We know our weaknesses and we have to fight
to maybe, distance ourselves from those situations.</p>

<p>Just like an alcoholic, when he leaves the office and gets into his car,
goes out of the office building, knows that “if I turn right, I go to a
certain street, and there's a hotel in that street, and there's a bar
there, and there's a bottle of whiskey on the shelf, and I can have a
wonderful conversation for the rest of the evening and roll home at two
in the morning.”</p>

<p>His battle comes not when he's coming out of the driveway of the office
parking. It comes when he starts to leave his office and plan his route
home. He knows he has to turn left instead of turning right.</p>

<p>Likewise, with the battles of the soul, we have to fight the battles far
away from the walls of the fortress. Distance ourselves from those
situations. Know our weaknesses, use all the human means, and also all
the supernatural means.</p>

<p>St. Paul says he had “a thorn in the flesh.” Three times he asked God
“that he would take it away.” And three times God said to him, “My grace
is sufficient for you, for strength is made perfect in weakness.” My
power is at full stretch in weakness.</p>

<p>“It is then,” says St. Paul, “about my weaknesses, that I am happiest of
all to boast, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me. That is why
I am glad of weaknesses, insults, constraints, persecution, and distress
for Christ's sake. For it is when I am weak that I am strong” (2 Cor.
12:7-10).</p>

<p>We have recourse frequently to the sacrament of Confession. The
life-giving, strength-giving grace of God comes into our souls in a
regular way.</p>

<p>The Holy Spirit will give us the fortitude to be able to fight in tough
moments, to begin again, to start over and not to be conquered and not
to wander into no-go areas, to be alert and watch ourselves in all sorts
of ways, so that we can fly.</p>

<p>I saw a picture in the newspaper one time of a KLM jumbo jet. It was
being transported through the canals of Amsterdam. The jumbo jet had
flown all over the world, carrying thousands and thousands of
passengers. And it had reached its end stage. It was being retired to
become a restaurant.</p>

<p>This picture showed this jumbo jet in the canals and passing some
houses, and it completely dwarfed the houses. It was a rather unusual
photograph to see this jumbo jet in the middle of all these houses
because they had cut off the wings to be able to transport it to where
it had to go.</p>

<p>It was an unusual photograph. It was very interesting, but there was
also something a little sad about the photograph. Here was this jumbo
jet that had carried thousands of people all over the world, done great
things, and soared to the heights of an eagle, but now it had no wings
and couldn’t fly anymore.</p>

<p>We have to try and make sure that we don't lose our wings. We keep them
in good shape so that they don't get caked with mud. A bird whose wings
are caked with mud cannot fly.</p>

<p>One great means to live this virtue well is to have frequent recourse to
the sacrament of Confession and to go there with great sincerity and get
rid of all the garbage.</p>

<p>Somebody said once we should think of the priest in Confession like a
garbage can and go there to empty out all the garbage. And when we get
rid of all those bad things, then our soul can breathe.</p>

<p>God fills us with His sanctifying grace. We experience the sacrament of
joy.</p>

<p>We're not worried about our weaknesses. We're capable of all the most
terrible things. We're all potential Hitlers.</p>

<p>But we have the answer. We have Confession, where we can start again
with a new hope, with a new optimism, with a new joy.</p>

<p>One writer said once, “You cannot play with the animal in you without
becoming wholly animal. You cannot play with falsehood without
forfeiting your right to truth. You cannot play with cruelty without
losing your sensitivity of mind. Whoever wants to keep their garden tidy
does not reserve a plot for weeds” (Dag Hammarskjöld, <em>Markings</em>).</p>

<p>Likewise, in our heart or in our soul, we can't reserve a plot for
weeds, put our Christian vocation into parenthesis, or indulge in things
that we know are incompatible with that Christian vocation.</p>

<p>Therefore, we need that spirit of struggle to go against the current.
Any dead thing can float downstream. Which is stronger, the reed that is
bent by the wind or the reed that stands up against the wind?</p>

<p>God wants us to be souls that stand up against the wind, the currents
that may be blowing, and there are a lot of bad ideas around the place.</p>

<p>I heard someone say once that perhaps the three people who have
influenced the thinking of the 20th century most are Malthus, Marx, and
Freud: Malthus with his population policies, Marx with communism, and
Freud with the sexual revolution.</p>

<p>To a certain extent, Marx is now passé, but the other two are still very
much with us. These are the winds that are blowing.</p>

<p>We have to try and know what is right and what is wrong, to keep up that
spirit of struggle, to keep ourselves in good shape, to be alert,
because the devil is like a lion ready to pounce, and whatever weak
moments we have, he can take full advantage.</p>

<p>There was an article in the newspaper some years ago that said that the
U.S. Army had rejected 25 percent of their recruits because of obesity.
They were too fat to fight. So 125 generals sent a letter to Congress
for a bill to talk about the nourishment of children.</p>

<p>We can't allow ourselves to become too fat to fight. We need to keep
ourselves in good shape to know who the enemy is and where the enemies
are, so that we won't be deceived by that lion who is ready to pounce.</p>

<p>A little kid went running into the police station one time and said,
“Quick, quick, my father has been fighting for over an hour!”</p>

<p>The policeman said, “Over an hour! But why didn't you call me before
now?” And he said, “In the beginning, he was winning.”</p>

<p>Sometimes that's what happens in our little battles. The devil allows
us to go a few rounds. He likes us to think that we're winning, that we
can handle this movie, or this song, or this conversation, or this
situation, or this environment, when the reality is that we can’t.</p>

<p>We're much weaker than we think. But we can be fooled into thinking
that we're strong.</p>

<p>We need to continually ask for this virtue. Purity, chastity, and
modesty—they're not the most important of virtues. The Sixth
Commandment is the sixth commandment, not the first, but it has its
place. And if we take care of those virtues, then we learn how to love.</p>

<p>People who don't understand purity, or chastity, or celibacy, or
modesty—it's because they don't understand human love, which is the
most beautiful reality on the planet, a reflection of divine love.</p>

<p>That's why the devil has declared war on the concept of human love. We
need to take care about how we practice that virtue.</p>

<p>“God is love” (1 John 4:8,16) and He wants us to reflect love in
everything that we do.</p>

<p>The sexual act is the most intimate union possible between two people in
this world. We have to safeguard everything about that. Keep it <em>open to
life</em>. Open to life means open to love. Love means giving. Lust means
getting.</p>

<p>Sometimes it's good to talk about things very clearly. When we go to
Confession or spiritual direction—to talk about these areas and to ask
for guidance, so that we come to understand these concepts a little
clearer, so that we can put them into practice a little better, in very
concrete ways, and also help many other people to practice these
virtues.</p>

<p>There's a story told about Pope St. John XXIII, who had been a nuncio
in many countries before becoming Pope.</p>

<p>One time he was at a diplomatic dinner in Paris, I think. There was a
lady sitting quite close to him who was not very well dressed.</p>

<p>After the first course, the nuncio, Cardinal Roncalli was his name,
picked up an apple from a bowl of fruit that there was in the center of
the table, and he offered it to this lady.</p>

<p>She looked at him a bit surprised and said, “Your Excellency, I didn't
ask for any fruit.”</p>

<p>And he said, “Madam, it was only after Eve ate the apple that she
realized what she was wearing.”</p>

<p>Sometimes we need to be clear with people—very clear, solid rules
about dealing with people of the opposite sex.</p>

<p>One of those rules could be never to be in a room alone with somebody of
the opposite sex, leave the door open, or to give lifts to people of the
opposite sex when you're alone.</p>

<p>You play with fire, you play with fire, because we don't know when
we're going to be weak. We don't know when other people are going to
be weak either. We want to take care of our Christian vocation.</p>

<p>There's a story told that in Edinburgh Castle, the crown jewels are
kept in a very special place in an electrified cabinet. Outside that
cabinet there are guards, and then there are more alarms, and then there
are more guards, and then there's the wall of the castle, and then
outside there are dogs roaming around the grounds, and then there are
the huge outer walls, and then there's a drawbridge, and then there's
a moat. So if anybody comes to try and steal the crown jewels, they’ll
have a pretty hard time.</p>

<p>The Queen doesn't walk around with the crown jewels in her handbag and
gives them to the first pretty face that she meets. Whoever arrives to
try and win the crown jewels arrives exhausted.</p>

<p>And so also, with the jewel of our heart, we have to keep it
well-bolted, well-guarded. It's a treasure. It's a pearl. God wants
that heart for Him, for Him alone.</p>

<p>“I urge you then, brothers,” says St. Paul, “remembering the mercies of
God, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, dedicated and
acceptable to God. That is the kind of worship for you, a sensible
people.</p>

<p>“Do not model your behavior on the contemporary world. Let the renewing
of your minds transform you, so that you may discern for yourselves what
is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and mature.</p>

<p>“And through the grace that I have been given, I say this to every one
of you: never pride yourself on being better than you really are, but
think of yourself dispassionately, recognizing that God has given to
each one his measure of faith” (Rom. 12:1-3).</p>

<p>We have to try and offer our bodies “as a living sacrifice.” Keep
ourselves in good shape and live our unity of life, which means living
our Christian vocation in every situation.</p>

<p>When Our Lord said to the apostles, “One of you will betray me,” he was
asked, “Is it I?” (Matt. 26:21-22). They all realized their weakness.</p>

<p>Weakness is no obstacle to holiness. God may have permitted our weakness
precisely to lead us to struggle a little more in that area, in that
way, so that from there we go forward.</p>

<p>We try to receive the sacrament of Confession regularly and stay very
close to the sacrament of Holy Communion.</p>

<p>Our Lord will come into our souls as a medicine, as a strength, to lead
us to be more joyful. Our good humor in charity and family life may be
closely related to how we live the virtues of purity and chastity.</p>

<p>I've been very impressed as a priest when, in the last thirty or forty
years, spouses who have come or come regularly for Confession, have
mentioned very spontaneously, “You know, Father, when I come to
Confession regularly, I see the fruits in my family. I can see there's
more peace in my home.”</p>

<p>They saw the social fruits of being in the state of grace. It was a very
beautiful testimony.</p>

<p>St. Josemaría in <em>The Forge</em> says, “Without God's help, it's
impossible to live a clean life. God wants us to be humble, and to ask
him for his help through our Mother, who is his Mother. You should say
to Our Lady, right now, speaking without the sound of words, from the
accompanied solitude of your heart: ‘O, my Mother, sometimes this poor
heart of mine rebels…But if you help me…’—She will indeed help you
to keep it clean and to follow the way God has called you to pursue. The
Virgin Mary will always make it easier for you to fulfill the will of
God” (J. Escrivá, <em>The Forge</em>, Point 315).</p>

<p>Other ways we have to turn to Our Lady can be the <em>Memorare</em>, the
Rosary, the Angelus, praying three Hail Marys to Our Lady at night,
turning to Our Lady frequently during the day. We know that she's
always listening to her children. She will never let us down. She’ll
always be there for us.</p>

<p>“Before, by yourself,” we're told in <em>The Way</em>, you couldn't. Now,
you've turned to Our Lady, and, with her, how easy it is!” (J. Escrivá,
<em>The Way</em>, Point 513).</p>

<p>“In these times of violence and brutal, savage sexuality, we have to be
rebels: we refuse point blank to go with the tide and become beasts. We
want to behave like children of God, like men and women who are on
intimate terms with their Father, who is in heaven, and who wants to be
very close to—inside!—each one of us” (J. Escrivá, <em>The Forge</em>,
Point 15).</p>

<p>We have human and supernatural means to conquer this battle, to live in
the presence of God with refinement.</p>

<p>Be very close to Our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament. Have recourse to Our
Lady in a filial way, to be humble and sincere, to empty our hearts and
our souls in the right place and the right way.</p>

<p>Take care of details and temperance proper to the children of God.
Practice modesty with refinement. Give ourselves generously to other
people.</p>

<p>We may know also that great fruits come from living this virtue.</p>

<p>St. Thomas Aquinas used to say that “from a pure heart there is born a
penetrating vision for what is divine.”</p>

<p>We see God in things and places, and grow to have more confidence in
God.</p>

<p>We learn to have more sincere repentance. We come to know ourselves a
little more, and also our sins. We come to have a true humility, a
greater awareness of ourselves. We come to have a greater love of God
and others.</p>

<p>It’s worth the effort to use all the means necessary, anything, rather
than commit a mortal sin.</p>

<p>If we're in the state of grace, God is in our soul. If we're not in
the state of grace, the devil is in our soul.</p>

<p>Some of the fruits of holy purity are that it gives us a big heart that
knows how to love. It can give us joy in times of hardship and fortify
our character in the face of difficulties. It also makes us more human,
able to understand others and their weaknesses. That's why we need
never be scandalized by the weaknesses of other people.</p>

<p>“There but for the grace of God go I.” We are all capable of the most
terrible things, so we need never be surprised by things we hear or see.</p>

<p>St. Thomas Aquinas says, “Curiosity is a defect of our mind, which
inclines us with eagerness and precipitation towards the focusing on
less useful things, making us neglect the things of God and our
salvation” (Thomas Aquinas, <em>Summa Theologiae</em>, Question 167).</p>

<p>We can turn to Our Lady, Virgin most pure, and ask her that she might
help us to grow with greater refinement in living this virtue, so that
she might never leave us alone but give us that strength from knowing
that we can always turn to Our Mother, the Mediatrix of all graces, and
receive all the help from her that we need.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and
inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I
ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint
Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
Amen.</em></p>

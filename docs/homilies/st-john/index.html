    <h1>St. John</h1>
    <p>By Fr. Conor Donnelly</p>

<p>(<em>Proofread</em>)</p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see
me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your
pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My
Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel,
intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>Today is the Feast of St. John, one of the Patrons of Youth. We find in
his letters, the first letter of St. John, Chapter 1, “This is the
declaration which we have heard from him, and declare unto you, that God
is light, and in him there is no darkness. If we say that we have
fellowship with him and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not speak the
truth. But if we walk in the light, as he also is in the light, we have
fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ, his Son,
cleanses us from all sin” (1 John 1:5-7).</p>

<p>Often the Gospel of John has been called the Gospel of Light, and his
other writings also focus a lot on light.</p>

<p>Young people today, as always, need a lot of light, of truth, of
doctrine. We can ask St. John today for all the apostolic work that we
do with young people, and that he might stir up our heart, like our
Founder wanted us to do, so that we might have a special eye for young
people, and always have a special interest in the work that Opus Dei
does with young people: the work of St. Raphael, which is entrusted also
to St. John.</p>

<p>He was a native of Bethsaida. His parents were Zebedee and Salome. He
was the brother of James the Greater, and we are told in St. Mark that
he “left his father Zebedee in the boat and followed him” (Mark 1:20).
He said yes to Jesus, and never stopped saying yes to Jesus, right to
the foot of the Cross.</p>

<p>He was enormously faithful. This is one of the reasons why our Father
had a great love for St. John. He was young, noble, pure, generous,
faithful, through thick and through thin. There were moments when the
other apostles ran away, but he stayed there right to the end, and it
was to him that the care of Our Lady was entrusted.</p>

<p>He had been a disciple of John the Baptist, until one day John the
Baptist pointed Jesus out to him: <em>“</em>Behold the Lamb of God” <em>(</em>John
1:36) and John committed himself.</p>

<p>Our Father loved that word “committed.” He talked a lot about how we
have to help young people to be committed. We’re told in<em>The Way</em>,
“Youth gives all it's got” (<em>cf</em>. Josemaría Escrivá, <em>The Way</em>, Point
30).</p>

<p>We're out to help the youth of today to be generous with their life, to
commit themselves to doing something decent with their lives, to be men
of ideals, of virtue, to do something great, and not “flutter about like
a barnyard hen” (J. Escrivá, <em>The Way</em>, Point 7).</p>

<p>The Gospel of John includes many things not emphasized in other Gospels.
It was written much later, towards the end of the first century, about
the year 97. It had a different literary style.</p>

<p>Like all the other apostles, John suffered a lot. During the persecution
of Diocletian, he was boiled in oil, but somehow, he survived. Later he
lived and died a natural death.</p>

<p>One of the goals of our interior life would be to have the intimacy of a
John. He was the one who sat beside Our Lord at the Last Supper; his
head rested on His breast.</p>

<p>John had a great heart, youthful, pure, generous. Our Father used to say
that our interior life could be modeled on the interior life of John. We
also could try and acquire the light that John had, to give light to the
world, a world that often walks in darkness.</p>

<p>In many areas of the world, young people are not being told the
truth—the truth about human love, about marriage, about purity,
chastity, modesty, virginity, celibacy.</p>

<p>“Again, therefore, Jesus spoke to them saying, ‘I am the light of the
world. He that follows me does not walk in darkness, but shall have the
light of life’” (John 8:12).</p>

<p>There was a kindergarten child once who was taking part in the Christmas
play. At one stage in the play, this little girl had to say the words,
“I am the light of the world.” But she forgot her lines.</p>

<p>Her mother was sitting in the front row and her mother tried to prompt
her. Her mother whispered to her, “I am the light of the world.”</p>

<p>The little girl piped up and said, “My mummy is the light of the world!”</p>

<p>We know that Jesus is the light of the world. He helps us to walk in
light, and to help the whole of society to walk in that light— hence
the importance of our apostolate of doctrine, of giving formation.</p>

<p>In the <em>Opening Prayer</em> of today's Mass, it says, “O God, Our Father,
you have revealed the mysteries of your Word through John the Apostle.
By prayer and reflection, may we come to understand the wisdom he
taught.”</p>

<p>In the <em>Prayer Over the Gifts</em>, it says, “Lord, bless these gifts we
present to you. With St. John, may we share in the hidden wisdom of your
eternal Word which you reveal at the Eucharistic table.”</p>

<p>We could ask Our Lord to follow in the footsteps of St. John, to follow
Our Lord with a youthful, undivided heart.</p>

<p>It's interesting to look at the vitality of St. Josemaría at the end of
his life. He said to many people, “You may not find too many people at
this stage of their life who talk about love the way I talk about love.”
He was a man who was fully in love right to the end of his life; very
youthful, very dynamic.</p>

<p>Lord, help us to put no resistance to your call, to be faithful to the
end, like St. John was when all the others had fled. Help us to have
faith in the Church, faith in the Holy Father, faith in our vocation, in
the Work, in the Father.</p>

<p>John showed special marks of friendship with Jesus. He was present on
special occasions, at the Transfiguration (Matt. 17:1, Mark 9:2 Luke
9:28), at the Agony in the Garden (Matt. 26:27, Mark 14:33). He had
things revealed to him that others didn't have revealed to them and all
the time he refers to himself in his Gospel as “the disciple whom Jesus
loved” (<em>cf</em>. John 13:23, 19:26). It's rather beautiful.</p>

<p>On the one hand he refers to himself in the third person, he doesn't
name himself—sort of anonymous. But he makes it very clear that “I was
the disciple whom Jesus loved” above Peter, above James, above so many
of the others.</p>

<p>When Our Lord appeared on the shore, when the apostles were out on the
lake and He tells them to cast the net to the other side of the boat,
they cast and they made a great haul of fish. Then John looks again at
the stranger on the shore and cries out, <em>Dominus</em> <em>est,</em> “It is the
Lord” (John 21:7). With his noble pure heart, he is the first to
recognize God.</p>

<p>“Blessed are the clean of heart, for they shall see God” (Matt. 5:8),
not just in the next life, but also in this one.</p>

<p>Later we're told that Peter jumped out of the boat and began to swim
ashore (John 21:7). But John was the first to recognize that it was
Jesus.</p>

<p>St. Edith Stein said, “Through John, we know how we are to participate
as our destiny in the life of Christ—as a branch of the divine
vine—and in the life of the triune God” (Edith Stein, <em>The Hidden
Life</em>).</p>

<p>In the stable at Bethlehem, these days when we come to adore Our Lord
like the shepherds, John seems to say to us, See what happens to those
who give themselves to God with pure hearts. In return, as a royal gift,
they may participate in the entire inexhaustible fullness of the
incarnate life of Christ.</p>

<p>Of all the apostles, John is the one who speaks most about charity:</p>

<p>“A new commandment I give you, that you love one another” (John 13:34).</p>

<p>“Little children,” he says on another occasion, “love one another” (1
John 3:18).</p>

<p>“Beloved,” he says in his letter, “let us love one another because love
is from God and everyone who loves is born of God and God is love” (1
John 4:7).</p>

<p>“If God has so loved us, let us love one another” (1 John 4:11).</p>

<p>Today is another one of those days when we approach the Christ Child in
the manger with true desire to learn how to love. Christ is Divine Love
personified, Incarnate Love, and every time that we approach the Christ
Child, we learn a little more about love. We fill our souls and our
hearts and our families with joy.</p>

<p>Pope Benedict says, “The true gift of Christmas is joy. You should bring
not expensive gifts that cost time and money, In today's world, God is
absent. People need anesthesia to live. They live in a dark world. With
a smile, an act of kindness, a little help, forgiveness, you can bring
joy and that joy will come back to you” (Benedict XVI, <em>Homily</em>,
December 18, 2005).</p>

<p>We can ask St. John today for that joy, as perhaps, in our prayer, we
think a little bit more about all those young people that God has placed
around us, so that we ask for the grace to see what He wants us to do
with them, so that we might “launch out into the deep” (Luke 5:4).
That's where God wants us in this great quest for the young people of
tomorrow, the leaders of tomorrow.</p>

<p>“I have come to spread fire on this earth, and what would I but that it
be enkindled” (Luke 12:49). We find in many of the writings of our
Father what sorts of wonderful words that can help us to think about
this great apostolate that he wants us to do.</p>

<p>We're told in <em>The Forge</em>, “We are children of God. —Bearers of the
only flame that can light up the paths of the earth for souls, of the
only brightness which can never be darkened, dimmed, or overshadowed.</p>

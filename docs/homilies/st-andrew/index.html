    <h1>St. Andrew</h1>
    <p>By Fr. Conor Donnelly</p>

<p>(<em>Proofread</em>)</p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see
me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your
pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My
Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel,
intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>“As he was walking along by the Lake of Galilee, he saw Simon and
Simon's brother Andrew casting a net in the lake, for they were
fishermen. And Jesus said to them, ‘Come after me and I will make you
into fishers of men.’ And at once they left their nets and followed him”
(Matt. 4:18-20).</p>

<p>Our Lord could have been admiring the view as He walked along by the
Lake of Galilee. He could have been admiring the lake. He could have
been looking at the beauty of creation. But we're told that He saw
Simon and Simon's brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they
were fishermen.</p>

<p>He saw them. He saw them because He was looking for them. The apostolic
heart of Christ was expressing itself in this particular moment. Our
Lord wants us to have an apostolic heart like He had.</p>

<p>Today is the Feast of St. Andrew the Apostle, and He formed all of the
apostles to have that type of apostolic heart, to see souls, to see
people, and to realize that those souls are the most important persons
or items in the whole world.</p>

<p>St. Josemaría liked to say that Our Lord called the apostles in the
middle of their ordinary work. He used to say that as ordinary
Christians in the middle of the world, we are called to transmit that
great apostolic sense to the ordinary place where God has placed us.</p>

<p>A young doctor told me once how he was in the medical residence one day
after lunch. There were fifteen or twenty young doctors taking coffee
and a senior registrar came in and began to talk about all the
sterilization operations he had performed.</p>

<p>Now this friend of mine would listen to meditations like this one, and
he felt uncomfortable because he knew this wasn't right. He felt he had
to do something. He didn't really know what to do or what to say, but
he invoked the Holy Spirit, and very politely but very clearly, he said
to this senior person:</p>

<p>“Well, I'd just like to say that I don't agree with what you're
saying.”</p>

<p>As soon as he said it, one lady leaned over towards him and said, “I
couldn't agree with you more.”</p>

<p>And on the other side somebody leaned over and said, “Terrible idiot!”</p>

<p>He realized that half the room was with him. All that was needed was one
voice to say something right, to say something true, to give a little
bit of light, a little bit of doctrine.</p>

<p>We have to try and have that apostolic heart of Christ that knows how to
beat in those ordinary moments that may come along, moments for us to
sow those grains of mustard seed (<em>cf</em>. Matt. 13:31-32), which may yield
an abundant harvest over time.</p>

<p>We could ask Our Lord today that we might see all of the apostolic
opportunities that our professional work gives rise to, so that we
don't miss them.</p>

<p>Every day in the <em>I Confess</em> we say ‘my thoughts, words, actions, and
omissions.’ It's possible that our greatest failures and weaknesses and
sins in the whole of our life may be our omissions—the things we could
have done but didn't do for lack of having that more apostolic heart of
Christ.</p>

<p>Jesus said to them, “Come after me and I will make you into fishers of
men” (Matt. 4:19).</p>

<p>He didn't say that “you'll make yourselves into fishers of men.”</p>

<p>“I will make you...”</p>

<p>Andrew and Simon could have said, “Fishers of men, but you don't fish
men, you fish fish!” But they listened to Him. His words rang deep in
their heart, and so they left their nets and they followed Him, never to
leave Him.</p>

<p>Andrew was a native of Bethsaida, a fisherman like his brother Simon,
whom he introduced to the Lord. He was a disciple of John the Baptist,
and he was one of the first to become a follower of Jesus. He pointed
out to Jesus the boy who had the few loaves and fishes, so that Our Lord
was able to work the miracle of their multiplication.</p>

<p>Often we have to be the person who points out to Jesus the place where
the miracle is needed, where a new light is needed, where a new influx
of grace is needed.</p>

<p>St. Andrew went on to preach the Gospel in Greece, and he died a martyr
on an inverted cross.</p>

<p>We're told in St. John, “They came and saw where he was staying, and
they stayed with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour” (John
1:39).</p>

<p>The Gospel informs us that Andrew and John are among the first apostles
to follow Jesus. Soon after, Our Lord began His public ministry. He
meets John the Baptist and two of his disciples. Seeing the Lord as He
passes by, the Precursor says, “Behold, the Lamb of God” (John 1:29).</p>

<p>Then Christ calls the ones who were the first to be closely associated
with His person and with His mission. They respond immediately.</p>

<p>“Jesus turns around, and seeing the two following him, says to them,
‘What is it you seek?’ They say, ‘Rabbi, where do you live?’ And he says
to them, ‘Come and see’” (John 1:38-39).</p>

<p>All during Our Lord's life, He was repeating those words, “Come and
see” (John 1:39). “Come, follow me, and I will make you into fishers of
men” (Matt. 4:19). “Come to me all you who labor and are heavily
burdened and I will give you rest (Matt. 11:28).</p>

<p>It's only at the end of His life that He says, Go: “Go ye therefore,
teach all nations” (Matt. 28:19).</p>

<p>We have to come before we can go. We cannot give what we do not have. We
have to grow in our friendship with Jesus from spending time with Him,
from talking to Him, from lowering the drawbridge of our heart and
sharing our intimate life with Him, so that He can enter into our heart,
mind, and soul.</p>

<p>Our Lord's invitation to them is very friendly: “No longer do I call
you servants, but I have called you friends” (John 15:15).</p>

<p>We are told, “Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two who
heard John the Baptist and followed him” (John 1:40).</p>

<p>That day, Our Lord spoke to them with divine wisdom and human charm.
They remain committed to Our Lord for good.</p>

<p>After many years have passed, St. John remembers the exact time of their
encounter in the Gospel. “It was about the tenth hour”—about four
o'clock in the afternoon. He never forgets the moment when Jesus said
to Him, “What do you seek?” (John 1:38-39).</p>

<p>There are certain moments in our life when Our Lord speaks to us in a
powerful way, when the Holy Spirit moves our soul and our heart, moments
that we never forget, when God reveals to us the purpose of our
vocation, or aspects of our Christian mission, or our purpose in the
world, or possibly new apostolic horizons that we hadn't even seen or
dreamt of before.</p>

<p>Andrew will also remember that decisive day. Neither of them ever
forgets that crucial encounter with Jesus.</p>

<p>To accept Our Lord's call and live as one of His intimate friends is
the greatest grace that a person can receive in this life. Our Lord
invites us to respond to that call on a daily basis, on an hourly basis.</p>

<p>The joyful day when we accept the clear invitation to follow the Master
is an occasion we can always treasure in our heart. The grace of
vocation is always an unmerited gift. The more divinely inspired it is,
the more highly we should esteem it, for our calling illuminates the
whole panorama of the future for us and gives meaning to our life.</p>

<p>When Our Lord gives us that calling, that vocation, He lights a candle
in our heart. It may be that the whole world may be trying to blow out
that candle. We have to take care of that flame; not let any harsh wind
blow on it; help it to become strong through the grace of God, through
the sacraments, through formation.</p>

<p>The call of vocation is often a gradual realization we come to
understand in the peace and calm of our prayer. Our Lord calls to us in
that intimate conversation, where we spend time with Him each day.</p>

<p>Sometimes, said one spiritual writer, His invitation, as in the case of
St. Paul, is manifested in a fashion as clear as a flash of lightning
which tears open the darkness that clouds our perspective.</p>

<p>The Master may also simply put His hand on one's shoulder and say, “You
are mine! Follow me!” The person in question is then filled with joy,
and “goes and sells all that he has and buys that field” where his
treasure lies (Matt. 13:44). Like a collector of fine pearls, the soul
concerned discovers “the pearl of great price” (Matt. 13:46), a great
price among the many gifts of life.</p>

<p>Our Lord encourages the first disciples, “Come and see.”</p>

<p>“In their personal dealings with Our Lord,” said St. Thomas, “Andrew and
John learn what is not immediately apparent to them through his words
alone” (Thomas Aquinas, <em>Commentary on St. John</em>).</p>

<p>Through our frequent prayer, we too can grow to perceive the many
invitations He addresses to us. We will then have a greater intimacy
with Jesus, and be able to follow Him more closely, and respond to His
gentle nudges.</p>

<p>In our prayer today, we could ask ourselves if we're really striving to
be attentive to the promptings of His voice. As we prepare for the great
period of Advent—prepare to accompany the Holy Family to Bethlehem, a
time of great spiritual bonanza which each year has new graces for us to
penetrate a little deeper into these mysteries—do we respond fully to
what Christ is asking of us? Maybe these days, a little more commitment,
a bit more generosity or detachment, or order, or focus on our family or
on our marriage, or on our friends.</p>

<p>Our Lord has wanted to depend on our support. Just as Our Lord was
present twenty centuries ago in the world, He's also always present in
the world today. “I am with you all days, even until the end of the
world” (Matt. 28:20).</p>

<p>Now more than ever, Our Lord is seeking men and women to collaborate in
this divine venture for the salvation of souls. There's no greater
enterprise. Responding positively to His invitation to become a fisher
of men is immensely worthwhile, because it entails cooperating in the
enterprise of eternal significance.</p>

<p>“Andrew…said to his brother Simon, ‘We have found the Messiah’” (John
1:41). The first thing Andrew does is he thinks of his brother, people
around him. He's missionary from the very start. We're told, “And he
led him to Jesus” (John 1:42).</p>

<p>God has placed souls around us, specific people, relatives, friends,
maybe strangers, and He wants us to do with them what Andrew did with
Simon: He led them to Jesus.</p>

<p>The meeting with Jesus left Andrew overjoyed. His newfound happiness is
a tremendous grace that he yearns to share with others immediately.
Likewise, the great spiritual moments of our life are somehow called to
share with others, an intimate conversation with them.</p>

<p>The first one that Andrew meets after this definitive encounter with
Jesus is his brother Simon. St. John Chrysostom says, “After Andrew
spends the entire day with Jesus, he does not keep the treasure for his
personal benefit, but hastens to share it with his brothers” (John
Chrysostom, <em>Homilies on St. John’s Gospel</em>).</p>

<p>Andrew's enthusiasm over this discovery when he speaks to Peter must
have been remarkable: “We have found the Messiah!” (John 1:41).</p>

<p>We can ask Our Lord to give us that apostolic enthusiasm whereby we want
to share with others the good things that God has given to us. Imitating
Andrew, we too can lead our relatives, friends, acquaintances to
Bethlehem, to Our Lord, to Our Lady, to St. Joseph, by speaking to them
of Our Lord with a confident conviction.</p>

<p>This personal testimony is appropriate for the man or woman who is
“filled with joy over the great things that Jesus offers us. So
wonderful is the news that the individual in question hastens to spread
it to others. It’s a proof of a sincere fraternal charity” (<em>ibid</em>.).
Anyone who truly finds Christ in a manner encounters Him for all his
closest relatives, friends, and colleagues.</p>

<p>Perhaps at a particular juncture in our life, Christ revealed Himself to
us, and we've been dealing with Him intimately for many years since
then. “Like Andrew, we too, through the grace of God, have had an
encounter with the Savior, and so understand more clearly the meaning of
the hope we are called to share with others” (John Paul II, <em>Address</em>,
November 30, 1982).</p>

<p>Often Our Lord makes use of the bonds of blood and friendship to call
others to His service. Family and social ties can often be the occasion
for the hearts of our relatives and friends to go out more fully to
Jesus.</p>

<p>This is one of the reasons why we have to meet people, be social, have
many friends, meet up with people, move around the place. We're not
meant to be huddled up in a corner like a rabbit. We have to open up
like a fan.</p>

<p>Sometimes Our Lord is prevented from entering other people's lives
because of prejudice, or fear, or ignorance, or laziness, or mental
reserve. But when friendship is authentic, no great effort is needed to
speak of Christ, because sincere confidence follows naturally in its
wake.</p>

<p>Friends interchange points of view and insights with ease. It would be
unnatural then for us to refrain from speaking about Christ, since He's
the greatest discovery we have made in our life, and is the motivating
force behind all our actions.</p>

<p>We've discovered the benefit of monthly recollections, or yearly
retreats, or weekly sacramental confession, or daily spiritual reading.
The most logical thing in the world is that we share it with other
people.</p>

<p>Through the grace of God, ordinary friendship can be a divine channel
for a profound personal apostolate. Backing up our cheerful words of
hope for those we deal with every day, many will be able to discover the
very same Jesus who is ever at our side.</p>

<p>St. Peter, as perhaps we ourselves have done, found Him through being
reflected in a person with whom he had regular contact.</p>

<p>St. Josemaría in <em>Christ Is Passing By</em> said, “One day perhaps an
ordinary Christian, just like you, opened your eyes to horizons both
deep and new, yet as old as the Gospel. He suggested to you the prospect
of following Christ earnestly, seriously, of becoming an apostle of
apostles. Perhaps you lost your balance then and didn't recover it.</p>

<p>“Your complacency wasn't quite replaced by true peace until you freely
said ‘yes’ to God, because you wanted to, which is the most supernatural
of reasons. And in its wake came a strong, constant joy, which
disappears only when you abandon him” (Josemaría Escrivá, <em>Christ is
Passing By,</em> Point 1).</p>

<p>We have all found that joy in following in the footsteps of the Master.
Because of it, we desire to share with many others this happiness that
we have found.</p>

<p>A little while later, there's the call of vocation. “He was walking by
the Sea of Galilee. He sees two brothers, Simon, who is called Peter,
and his brother Andrew. … He says, ‘Come and follow me.’ And at once
they responded” (Matt. 4:18-20).</p>

<p>This call is the culmination of their first encounter with the Master.
Like the other apostles, Andrew responds at once. Each of them practices
heroic detachment from their material possessions so that they can
follow in the footsteps of the Master.</p>

<p>St. Gregory the Great comments on the definitive call of these
fishermen. He says the Kingdom of heaven is “all the more valuable the
greater the extent of the earthly riches we forego for the sake of the
kingdom of heaven” (Gregory the Great, <em>Sermons of the Gospels</em>).</p>

<p>Our surrender to Jesus, like that of the apostles, must be total. Peter
and Andrew leave a great deal behind them. They “both lose their desire
for their possessions” (<em>ibid</em>.). The Lord wants to depend on men and
women who are pure of heart, people with big hearts not tied to earthly
goods.</p>

<p>Each Christian is called to live the spirit of dedication in accordance
with his or her personal vocation. There's no room in our life for
anything that doesn't serve completely for giving God glory—a total
commitment.</p>

<p>As we are about to follow Our Lady and St. Joseph along their journey to
Bethlehem, we see before our eyes the message of total commitment,
leaving everything. When we turn to Our Lord who is so close to us every
day, what could we possibly hold back for ourselves alone?</p>

<p>Christ enters into our lives too. That virtue of detachment helps us to
stay at the side of Our Lord as He goes forward on His mission at a fast
and steady pace.</p>

<p>No matter what stage of our life we're at, we're living out our
mission, our apostolic vibration, through our prayer, through our
mortification, through our moving souls. It's not possible for us to
keep up with Him if we have too much baggage. We can't be left behind
on account of a few material possessions that are not worth our
excessive concern for them.</p>

<p>Sometimes, Our Lord issues a personal call at an early age. At other
times, one's vocation becomes clear in the course of one's mature
years, when we only have a short distance to go before we arrive in His
presence.</p>

<p>There is such variety in the time the Lord chooses to call each of us.
It's shown in the parable concerning the laborers who go out to work at
different times of the day (Matt. 20:1-16).</p>

<p>Whichever our own case may be, we are called to respond with joy—with
the joy the Evangelists express when they recall the circumstances of
their own definitive vocation. Our Lord is the same now as then. He's
the one who invites us to accompany Him on our way.</p>

<p>Tradition recalls how St. Andrew died praising the cross of his
crucifixion, since it was the means for at last drawing him finally
close to the Master.</p>

<p>We're told that on the cross he said, “Hail, O Cross! Receive the
disciple of him who hung from thee—my Master Christ! O good Cross, so
long desired and now awaiting my thirsty heart, in tranquil joy and
exultant security I come to you! You host received the beauty and
loveliness of the members of the Lord; do you now receive me and take me
from men and join me again to my Master, so that he who by you redeemed
me, may by you also receive me” (<em>The Passion Prayer of St. Andrew</em>).</p>

<p>We also learn from St. Andrew that whatever is most difficult for us to
offer Our Lord will be easy if we join our own sacrifice to the loving
offerings of Christ.</p>

<p>Pope St. John Paul at the start of the new millennium said, “The
missionary mandate accompanies us into the Third Millennium and urges us
to share the enthusiasm of the very first Christians: we can count on
the power of the same Spirit. It was poured out at Pentecost and it
compels us still today to start out anew, sustained by the hope ‘which
does not disappoint’ (Rom. 5:5)” (John Paul II, Encyclical, <em>Novo
millenio ineunte</em>, Point 42).</p>

<p>In those early formation days of the apostles, and also later on, Our
Lady was to perform a very special role: keeping them united, helping
them to solidify their formation.</p>

<p>We can ask Our Mother, the Queen of the Apostles, that she might help us
to follow in the footsteps of all the apostles today, like St. Andrew;
to have the heart and mind of St. Andrew, and to launch out into the
deep in all the ways that God is asking us to.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and
inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I
ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint
Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
Amen.</em></p>

    <h1>Dedication of the Basilica of St. Mary Major</h1>
    <p>By Fr. Conor Donnelly</p>

<p>(<em>Proofread</em>)</p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see
me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your
pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My
Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel,
intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>“It happened that as he was speaking, a woman in the crowd raised her
voice and said, ‘Blessed is the womb that bore you and the breast that
fed you.’ But he replied, ‘More blessed still are those who hear the
word of God and keep it!’” (Luke 11:27-28).</p>

<p>Some commentators like to say that this woman praised Our Lord on the
human plane, natural plane, but Our Lord raised His response onto a
supernatural plane: “Blessed are they who hear the word of God and keep
it.”</p>

<p>The one who most heard the word of God and kept it was Our Lady.</p>

<p>Jesus exalts Our Lady. When we make a lot of fuss and give a lot of
attention to Our Lady, we're just doing what Jesus did.</p>

<p>Today, we celebrate the dedication of the Basilica of St. Mary Major in
Rome.</p>

<p>After the promulgation of the dogma of the Divine Maternity of Mary at
the Council of Ephesus in 431, Pope Sixtus III consecrated a basilica in
Rome in honor of the Blessed Virgin, which was later called St. Mary
Major.</p>

<p>It is the oldest church dedicated to Our Lady in the world.</p>

<p>If you were watching recently when Pope Francis was discharged from
hospital, on his way back to the Vatican he passed by St. Mary Major to
make a short little pilgrimage to Our Lady to thank her for his health
and his convalescence.</p>

<p>Every time that he goes out of Rome on an international trip, he also
passes by that basilica. He goes there carrying a little bouquet of
flowers—nothing big, something small, something he can carry
himself—and he places it on the altar in front of Our Lady.</p>

<p>It's a rather beautiful childlike gesture of Marian piety; something we
can all learn from.</p>

<p>Today's feast is also known as the Feast of Our Lady of the Snows, due
to an ancient legend about a Roman who asked Our Lady's guidance on how
best to use his fortune.</p>

<p>In the early hours of August 5th, in the middle of the Roman summer, Our
Lady told him in a dream to build a church in her honor wherever he
found snow on the Esquiline Hill, one of the hills of Rome.</p>

<p>That same morning, snow appeared miraculously on the site where the
Basilica of St. Mary Major now stands.</p>

<p>Every year on August 5th, in the evening time, some people go up onto a
little parapet or balcony that there is in a side altar there, where the
image of Our Lady is.</p>

<p>They throw out white rose petals that fall to the ground, imitating that
fall of snow so many centuries ago. It’s one of those little beautiful
details that Rome is full of.</p>

<p>Today we celebrate the dedication of this basilica, the oldest and most
venerable church in the Western world consecrated to Our Lady.</p>

<p>Many events in the history of the Church have taken place there.</p>

<p>That particular basilica also houses the relics of the crib in which Our
Lord was born in Bethlehem. St. Matthias lies beneath the altar of the
crib. The body of St. Jerome is also buried somewhere there. St.
Ignatius of Loyola celebrated his first Mass there. The dalmatic worn by
St. Thomas of Canterbury when he was struck down in the cathedral is
also there, upon which blood stains are visible. It is full of history.</p>

<p>It was built in the fourth century, shortly after the Council of Ephesus
ended.</p>

<p>The people of the city of Ephesus celebrated with enormous enthusiasm
the official declaration of the truth that they had long believed, and
joy spread throughout the Church. In Rome, this enormous basilica was
built.</p>

<p>That Council of Ephesus defined Our Lady as the Mother of God. This was
a very special event in the history of the Church and in the history of
the world.</p>

<p>The faithful in Rome have honored Our Lady in that basilica under the
invocation of <em>Salus Populi Romani</em>, the Health of the Roman People. She
is the Patroness of Rome.</p>

<p>They come, as to a place where their petitions are always heard, to ask
favors and graces. John Paul II also paid a visit to Our Lady there,
just after his election to the Pontificate.</p>

<p>On that occasion he said: “Mary is called to lead all people to the
Redeemer and to bear witness to him without words, through love alone,
in a way that shows her motherly disposition” (Pope John Paul II,
<em>Homily</em>, December 8, 1978).</p>

<p>“Blessed are those that hear the word of God and keep it” (Luke 11:28).</p>

<p>Mary was always hearing the word of God. She was continually keeping all
these things in her heart, meditating on that word, responding to that
word.</p>

<p>“She is called to draw even those who offer stubborn resistance, the
ones for whom it is more difficult to believe in Christ's love. The
vocation of Mary is to bring each person closer to her Son” (<em>Ibid</em>.).</p>

<p>At her feet, John Paul II offered the Mother of God his whole life and
deepest desires: <em>Totus tuus—</em>a dedication that each one of us can
also make, imitating him as good children imitate their parents.</p>

<p>He said to Our Lady: “I am yours, I am all yours, and everything I have
is yours. May you be my guide in everything.”</p>

<p>With Our Lady as Our Protectress, we will always advance with a sure
step along our way.</p>

<p>The mystery of the Incarnation has allowed the Church to penetrate and
shed ever more light on the mystery of the Mother of the Word Incarnate.</p>

<p>For that reason, the Council of Ephesus in 431 was of particular
importance.</p>

<p>St. Cyril of Alexandria describes how, “From the first hours of the
morning until evening, all the people of the city of Ephesus anxiously
awaited the outcome.</p>

<p>“When it was known that the author of the blasphemies, Nestorius, had
been deposed, all as one began to glorify God and acclaim the Synod
since the enemy of the Faith had fallen.</p>

<p>“On leaving the Church, we were accompanied,” he said, “to our homes by
torchlight. It was nighttime. The whole city was joyful and brilliantly
lit up” (St. Cyril of Alexandra, <em>Epistles</em>).</p>

<p>We can see that the faith of the people of Ephesus was strong and
vibrant.</p>

<p>In a homily given a short time later, St. Cyril praised the Motherhood
of Mary. “Hail Mary,” he said, “Mother of God, Blessed Virgin Mother,
Morning Star…Hail Mary, most precious jewel of the whole world.”</p>

<p>St. Thomas Aquinas says: “As the Mother of God, her dignity is in a
certain sense infinite on account of the limitless goodness of God.
Similarly, greater dignity than hers there cannot be, just as there
cannot be any greater than God” (Thomas Aquinas, <em>Summa Theologiae</em>, I,
Question 25).</p>

<p>She is above all the angels and saints in dignity. After the Sacred
Humanity of her Son, she is that part of creation which is the purest
reflection of the glory of God.</p>

<p>In her, as in no other creature, shines a participation in the divine
gifts—wisdom, beauty, goodness. … “There is no stain in her. She is
a reflection of eternal light, the immaculate mirror of the action of
God, and an image of his goodness” (Wis. 7:25-26).</p>

<p>We can try to remember today her Divine Motherhood, the root of all her
graces, virtues and perfections.</p>

<p>St. Bernard says that Mary is the channel through which we daily receive
the grace we require.</p>

<p>We can always turn to her, since “it is the will of the Lord, who wants
us to obtain everything at His Mother's hands, particularly when we
find ourselves in the midst of special difficulties or temptations” (St.
Bernard, <em>Homily on the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary</em>).</p>

<p>Like little children, we need to have recourse to her as often as we
can, for our spiritual needs, and also for our bodily needs.</p>

<p>The spiritual Motherhood of Mary reached a climax next to her Son on
Calvary. When all have fled, Our Lady remained “beside the Cross,
standing,” suffering and co-redeeming, in perfect conformity with the
will of God (John 19:25).</p>

<p>“More blessed still are those who hear the word of God and keep it”
(Luke 11:28).</p>

<p>The Second Vatican Council says, “She is not a purely passive instrument
in the hands of God, but cooperates in the salvation of men with free
faith and obedience” (Vatican II, <em>Lumen gentium</em>, Point 56).</p>

<p>And she continues to exercise her loving maternity unremittingly, and
now in heaven, it says, “she has not given up this salvific activity,
but through her constant intercession continues to obtain for us the
gift of eternal salvation” (<em>Ibid</em>., Point 62).</p>

<p>We can thank Our Lord for giving us such a Mother, His own Mother.</p>

<p>“Son, behold your mother” (John 19:26). Look at your mother, and never
stop looking at her. He gives us His own mother to help us to draw close
to the life of grace.</p>

<p>She loves us as any earthly mother. She never stops looking at us
because He has told her to look at your child: “Behold your child.”</p>

<p>The spiritual motherhood of Mary goes very far. She engenders us in the
supernatural order.</p>

<p>The power to become sons and daughters of God, “to participate in the
divine nature” (2 Pet. 1:4), has been given to us, thanks to the
redemptive action of Christ, who forms us in His own likeness, a
fashioning that comes through Mary.</p>

<p>A lady stood up at a get together with St. Josemaría once and said that
every day when she's going to Mass, she says to her three- or
four-year-old daughter: “I'm going to receive Jesus.” Every day, she
would say that to the child.</p>

<p>One day the child said, "And will you receive Mary also?”</p>

<p>This lady said to St. Josemaría, "Father, what should I tell my
daughter?”</p>

<p>St. Josemaría had to think for a moment. It wasn't one of the usual
questions that he was often asked.</p>

<p>After a moment, he replied thus: “In a way, yes, because the Body of
Christ before was the body of Mary. The Blood of Christ before was the
blood of Mary. In a certain sense, when we receive Jesus, we receive
Mary also.”</p>

<p>Through her intercession, we receive all the spiritual nourishment that
we need every day, defense against our enemies, consolation in our
sufferings.</p>

<p>In the eyes of Our Lady, St. Josemaría says, “we never cease to be
little ones. She shows us the way to the kingdom of heaven, which is for
those who become small children. ‘Unless you become like little
children, you cannot enter the kingdom of heaven’ (Matt. 18:3).</p>

<p>“We need to stay attentively by her side,” like little children who
never like to be far from their mother or to let her be out of sight,
“by constantly having recourse to her, telling her loving things,
showing her our affection, pondering the scenes of her life on earth,
sharing our struggles with her, our successes and failures.</p>

<p>“In this way, sharing our life with her, contemplating the mysteries of
her earthly existence, we discover the meaning of the traditional Marian
prayers of the Church, as if we were reciting them for the first time.”</p>

<p>Remember, O most gracious Virgin Mary, never was it known that anyone
who fled to your protection, implored your help, or sought your
intercession was left unaided (<em>Memorare</em>).</p>

<p>“The <em>Hail Mary</em> and the <em>Angelus</em> are loving praises of her divine
motherhood.” We remind her of her vocation as a mother, something that
she likes to be reminded of with great frequency.</p>

<p>“When we say the Rosary…our minds and our hearts reflect on the
mysteries of Mary's admirable life, which at the same time, are the
mysteries of our faith.</p>

<p>"As the feasts of Our Lady come round each year, may we not be sparing
in the details of affection we show her. We raise our hearts to her more
often and ask her for what we need.</p>

<p>“We give thanks for her constant motherly care and entrust those we love
to her. Naturally though, if we really want to act as good children,
every day is a good occasion on which to express affection for those who
really love one another” (Josemaría Escrivá, <em>Friends of God</em>, Points
290-291).</p>

<p>We could say to her, as the hymn in Latin says, <em>Monstra te esse
matrem</em>–Show yourself to be Our Mother. Show yourself in all your
motherly ways that you are there to help us.</p>

<p>The feast of Our Lady of Snows is particularly associated with the
virtue of purity. Our souls are called to be snow-white in the vision of
Christ.</p>

<p>“Blessed are the clean of heart, for they shall see God” (Matt. 5:8).</p>

<p>Mary, may you teach us to love the Lord Our God with all our heart. Keep
our heart clean to see the positive meaning of this virtue.</p>

<p>It is “a joyful affirmation” (J. Escrivá, <em>The Forge</em>, Point 92), a
direct consequence of our love for God and souls.</p>

<p>St. Josemaría liked to say, “When you decide firmly to lead a clean
life, chastity will not be a burden, but a victorious crown” (J.
Escrivá, <em>The Way</em>, Point 123).</p>

<p>We need to place the means for this love to grow each day; take care of
all the aspects in which we need to live this virtue.</p>

<p>If that virtue is to be made up of positive details, and if it is to be
a virtue, then it has to grow, to be perfected. For its relationship
with Love, with the capital L, means that it can always admit of
development.</p>

<p>Mary, help us to grow in this virtue, take care of it; to guard our
heart with seven bolts; to call things by their name; and to defend
ourselves in the face of everything that could be a danger to our
fidelity, which is what any person in love does.</p>

<p>There is a story told of Pope John XXIII who, before he became Pope, was
a nuncio in Turkey and also in France. He had to attend many diplomatic
dinners with all sorts of diplomats.</p>

<p>On one occasion, he was seated close to a lady who was very badly
dressed.</p>

<p>There was a bowl of fruit in the center of the table. After the first
course of the dinner, he took up an apple and he handed it to her.</p>

<p>She looked at him a bit surprised and said, “Your Excellency, I didn't
ask for any fruit."</p>

<p>He said, “Madam, it was only after Eve had the apple that she realized
what she was wearing.”</p>

<p>Sometimes we have to be very clear. We should defend ourselves and other
people. Defend the environment of our home, care with television
programs, having a sensitive conscience for movies.</p>

<p>If we wouldn't bring children to a red-light district of the city, then
we shouldn't bring that red-light district into our living room.</p>

<p>We should try and flee from all occasions of sin. “If your hand is an
occasion of sin to you, cut it off” (cf. Matt. 5:30).</p>

<p>Just like the alcoholic, who has to plan carefully his journey home to
avoid that street where that hotel is because: ‘I know there's a bar
there and there are bottles in that bar.’</p>

<p>His battle, or her battle, begins the moment she begins to leave the
office, choosing the route home. It doesn't begin when he's entering
the lobby of the hotel.</p>

<p>We have to fight our battles far away from the walls of the fortress. We
need to be aware of unnecessary temptations. The devil, we're told in
Scripture, is like a lion ready to pounce (Lam. 3:10).</p>

<p>When people are driving along the roads, they meet with traffic
policemen, traffic lights, yellow lines, one-way streets, no-parking
zones. All these seem to be a nuisance and limitations on our freedom.
But, in fact, they favor the driver because they help them to drive with
gracious security and pleasure.</p>

<p>We need to be protected against our own weaknesses—and we all know how
weak we can be.</p>

<p>We also don't know how weak others can be in certain moments. We can't
trust ourselves or think we're strong, or think other people are
strong.</p>

<p>We can't allow ourselves to get into compromising situations. And for
that, we have to have foresight, to be clever.</p>

<p>Have the courage to flee if things go wrong, because we know we have
feet of clay. “We carry this treasure in earthenware vessels,” says St.
Paul (cf. 2 Cor. 4:7).</p>

<p>St. Thomas Aquinas defines curiosity. He says, “Curiosity is a defect of
our mind which inclines us with eagerness and precipitation towards
the…study of less useful subjects, making us neglect the things of God
and our salvation. This curiosity is born of spiritual sloth…and makes
us lose precious time” (St. Thomas Aquinas, <em>Summa Theologiae</em>, II,II,
Questions 167, 35).</p>

<p>It's like a mania for collecting useless data. St. John of the Cross
calls it “stupid intellectual curiosity, and…is the inverse of
contemplation.”</p>

<p>In this battle we often need to give importance to what is small. Often
the devil enters through small things, little lacks of struggle here or
there, little negligences in things that could be important.</p>

<p>Those small points that may be so small as not to appear important to
us—that's where the battles have to be fought: in the guarding of our
eyes, in the things we read, in entertainment, in dealing with people of
the opposite sex, in certain conversations.</p>

<p>These may be small things with no apparent importance but, if left
unchecked, they can do all sorts of terrible things.</p>

<p>Blessed Álvaro says: “Whoever struggles to guard their senses, not only
sight but also, for example, hearing;</p>

<p>“Whoever is prudent in dealing with their colleagues at work, shunning
frivolity, not giving in in what is incompatible with the demands of
love, not striving to create a good impression at any cost;</p>

<p>“Whoever is sincere with God and with themselves, and in spiritual
direction, recognizing perhaps that their heart harbors an affection
that does not belong to God—if they follow the advice they receive,
cutting things off radically from the start with ordinary or
extraordinary means, that person will not fail. They will be faithful to
their Christian vocation.”</p>

<p>We can seek our consolation and our strength in Christ. Receiving Holy
Communion as often as we can is the great medicine for our soul. The
Bread of Life helps us to be strong in temptation.</p>

<p>Our devotion to the Blessed Sacrament can help us to drive out diabolic
attachments with the expulsive force of a new love as we begin again,
telling Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament: ‘Jesus, I love you, increase my
love. Teach me how to love you more and more.’</p>

<p>We can seek the forgiveness of Our Merciful Lord in the Confessional,
and turn also with greater frequency to Our Lady of Snows, asking her to
make our soul pure and clean like a snowflake.</p>

<p>Our Mother of Fair Love will help us. She will help us to overcome the
many temptations of the flesh, and to live holy purity as she lived it
so perfectly with St. Joseph.</p>

<p>We are told in <em>The Forge</em>: “Whenever you feel the stirrings of your
poor flesh, which sometimes attacks with violent assaults, kiss your
crucifix, kiss it many times with firm resolve, even if it seems…that
you are doing so without love” (J. Escrivá, <em>The Forge</em>, Point 317).</p>

<p>And he says: “Because we shall always have to put up with this little
donkey which is our body, in order to conquer sensuality you have to
practice daily and generously little mortifications—and sometimes big
ones as well. And you must live in the presence of God, who never ceases
to watch over you” (J. Escrivá, <em>The Forge</em>, Point 90).</p>

<p>We could ask Our Lady of the Snows, <em>Salus Populi Romani</em>, Health of the
Roman People, that we might also have that recourse to her, like we see
Pope Francis doing at the end of his [trips], like a little child.</p>

<p>Mary, may we also go to you with little flowers, simple little things
that we can carry—very personal, very intimate—so that we may learn
to love you more and ask you to help us in living the virtue of purity a
little better.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and
inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I
ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint
Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
Amen.</em></p>

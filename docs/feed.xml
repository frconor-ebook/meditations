Conor Donnelly</p>

<p>(<em>Proofread</em>)</p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>A lawyer in Sydney, Australia tells a story of how one day an elderly couple came to see him. He was 86 and she was 83. The lawyer asked them, “What can I do for you?”</p>

<p>And they said, “We want to get a divorce.”</p>

<p>“Why do you want to get a divorce?” “Because we don’t love each other anymore.”</p>

<p>“How long have you been married?” “Forty years.”</p>

<p>The lawyer tried to quickly recall all the points from the meditation he heard about charity and perseverance and fidelity on his last retreat, and he gave them an impromptu talk.</p>

<p>“Charity is patient, charity is kind” (1 Cor. 13:4). It’s beginning again. It’s loving other people with their defects. It’s letting the waters pass under the bridge. It’s not making a mountain out of a molehill, et cetera.</p>

<p>He asked them to go away, think about it for a while, come back some other day, and they would talk a little more. The couple went away, and three years later the wife came back.</p>

<p>She said, “I’ve just come back to tell you that my husband just passed away. But I want to thank you because we’ve just had three of the most wonderful years of our whole life.”</p>

<p>The moral of the story is that we’re always beginning again in love. Love is a mystery. “God is love” (1 John 4:8).</p>

<p>In the course of our life, we try to learn a little more about that mystery of love. Perseverance and fidelity in marriage are very much based on love and keeping that love alive—taking care of that love.</p>

<p>We have the grace from the sacrament to help that to happen. St. Paul says, “My grace is sufficient for you” (2 Cor. 12:9).</p>

<p>He also says; “Let us never slacken in doing good, for if we do not give up, we shall have a harvest in due time” (Gal. 6:9).</p>

<p>We have to keep trying to persevere in doing good, working at our marriage, beginning again; keeping our love young and fresh after many years like it was before we got married.</p>

<p>St. Josemaría liked to give great importance to details (Josemaría Escrivá, <em>Friends of God</em>, Point 122; <em>The Forge</em>, Point 870, etc.). Love is in the details. Perfection is in the details. It’s remembering little things. It’s sweeping the other party off their feet from time to time with little gestures of love and affection.</p>

<p>There is a song by Julio Iglesias in Spain many years ago. It’s the lament of a man whose loved one has left him. The title of the song is <em>Me Olvidé de Vivir los Detalles Pequeños–</em>I Forgot to Take Care of the Small Details. Often those small details can cost us a little bit.</p>

<p>The Lord said, “If anyone wants to be a follower of mine, let him renounce himself and take up his cross every day and follow me” (Matt. 16:24).</p>

<p>That’s quite a program for marriage: to renounce ourselves, forget about ourselves, and take up the cross that God has planned for us. That’s the marriage vocation.</p>

<p>We have a vocation that comes with our Baptism: a vocation to holiness. Then there’s a specification of that vocation over the years and in the course of our life.</p>

<p>One of the specifications of that vocation is our vocation to marriage—to this particular person at this particular time in history; in this particular place; with these particular difficulties of finance, of health, of employment.</p>

<p>St. Paul says, “We’ve been chosen out before the foundation of the world” (<em>cf</em>. Eph. 1:4). Every aspect of our life has been chosen by God. Nothing is an accident.</p>

<p>God wants us to work then at making our marriage a success, and in making our family life a success, so that the domestic Church can really be everything that it’s supposed to be: a pathway to holiness, a seedbed of vocations.</p>

<p>That means each spouse has to try and live like a great human person—a great human person that gives example to children of what being a great human person means—which ultimately means virtue. Living the virtues in a concrete way.</p>

<p>By doing so, we reveal gold—spiritual gold—to the other members of our family, to our spouse, to our neighbors, to our friends.</p>

<p>But gold nuggets don’t sit on top of the soil. One needs to dig. Often, one has to dig with patience, with constancy, with effort. One has to begin and begin again with a new hope, with a new perseverance.</p>

<p>And so, perseverance in marriage is a gift of God. It’s a grace that we have to ask for. Pray for it. Ask for it. It’s the fruit of faith, of hope, of love.</p>

<p>Our perseverance in our marriage vocation makes many things possible. It’s a commitment of love. We’re committed.</p>

<p>It’s not something that’s superficial. We’re not a fly-by-night when it comes to this particular reality. We’ve given our word, and love seeks to be definitive.</p>

<p>God will always give us the power to go on, even if we feel we don’t have any more energy, or willpower, or desire.</p>

<p>To love is to do things God’s way. He said, “I am the way, the truth, and the life” (John 14:6).</p>

<p>In Christ, we find the meaning and the purpose of our life (<em>cf</em>. Pope John Paul II, <em>Homily</em>, August 14, 1993), and very particularly, in Christ on the Cross we find the meaning and the purpose of our life.</p>

<p>We draw close to the Sacred Humanity of Christ and to His wounds: “To draw water, in joy, from the wells of salvation” (Isa. 12:3).</p>

<p>If we trust in Him, we will not be disappointed. We derive our strength from Christ for the battles that we need.</p>

<p>We can “leave the past to God’s mercy, the future to God’s providence” (St. Augustine) and live “the sacrament of this moment” (Jean Pierre de Caussade). It’s a gift.</p>

<p>A sacrament is something that has a visible and an invisible part. We’re living out the sacrament of this moment: what we see, what we feel, what we hear.</p>

<p>But there’s an invisible part. God lives in an eternal now and we know that He has a gold medal prepared for us. It does not corrode. There is merit in struggle, and God wants us to get that merit.</p>

<p>Love is a decision: ‘I will love you into heaven.’</p>

<p>We know that in the battles and the challenges and the journeys of every day, the winds may blow. But if the house is founded on rock—not just the rock of doctrine, but the rock of family life, of apostolate, of Our Lady—the building will not fall.</p>

<p>But for this, we need to struggle. We need to sacrifice ourselves. Sacrifice needs to be always present in our daily life.</p>

<p>Sometimes, perseverance needs sacrifice. If you look at any of the long-distance runners, Kenyan runners that win the marathons all over the world, there’s tremendous sacrifice there. There’s tremendous perseverance.</p>

<p>We’ve got to be careful with that perseverance. To put our perseverance in danger could be a serious sin of infidelity to God in this wonderful commitment of love that God wants us to live out.</p>

<p>At the bottom of all infidelity, there is a pocket of corruption. Something that wasn’t right from the start. Something that needs to be clarified.</p>

<p>That’s one of the reasons why we have to be very careful about our formation: our marriage formation, our spiritual formation, our doctrinal formation.</p>

<p>The Church places an awful lot of importance on formation. Often in parishes, there’s a pre-marriage course or pre-marriage formation. But of course, the whole of our marriage isn’t just prepared for in one short seminar on a quick weekend.</p>

<p>We start preparing for our marriage in primary school, in our own families, in what we see in the lives of our parents, and how we build family life at home.</p>

<p>We work at that marriage preparation through high school, possibly through third-level education. A lot of it involves the formation in virtue.</p>

<p>But humans are fickle-minded. All the apostles said “yes” to Christ, but one changed his mind.</p>

<p>The passing things of this world can never be the source of our happiness. So, we have to be a little bit careful with football, or fashion, or the movies, or professional success.</p>

<p>Our happiness has to come from much deeper things. We find our happiness in the risen Lord.</p>

<p>Just like our marriage, life may not be a romance all the time. There might be periods of dryness, or no ideas, or no affections.</p>

<p>Our spiritual life might be the same. But we’ve got to work at it. Go back and begin again.</p>

<p>The goal of our fidelity is not just for fifty years’ time, but in this moment. It cannot just depend on our mood, on our health, on our hormones, on our family situation.</p>

<p>Fidelity is something dynamic. It’s not static. It finds expression every day.</p>

<p>Mother Teresa was once asked if she really thought that all the things she was doing could make an impact in the poverty of India. Would she be able to solve all the problems of India? The problems of poverty?</p>

<p>Her answer was very quick: “I am not called to be successful. I am [just] called to be faithful” (Art Beals with Larry Libby, <em>Beyond Hunger: Biblical Mandate for Social Responsibility–Foreword</em> by Mark O. Hatfield).</p>

<p>There’s a lot of wisdom for that in every Christian vocation in the world. I may not be very successful in building my family, in building my marriage, in earning money, in my profession, in various areas.</p>

<p>But I am called to be faithful—and to try to do so with a sense of humor and perspective, so that I never give up on the ideal of marriage and married love.</p>

<p>If the solutions to the problems of marriage and family in the world today don’t come from the Catholic Church, they’re not going to come from anywhere, because we have the truth. We have the answers. It’s all there in the documents of the Church. Spiritual treasures.</p>

<p>We have to try and know very well the ideal of marriage and married love to understand what love is. Human love is one of the most beautiful realities on the planet. It’s a reflection of divine love. That’s why the devil has gone to so much trouble to mess it up for young people.</p>

<p>Our marriage vocation is a vocation to witness to the truth of authentic love—the truth, the beauty, and the meaning of conjugal love. That’s why fidelity in marriage is always moving and inspiring.</p>

<p>Fidelity is to fall in love with God—to grow in this day by day, and to foster this around us; to focus on one thing, not many.</p>

<p>Our Lord said to Martha, “Only one thing is necessary” (Luke 10:42). It’s not difficult to persevere in marriage. The vast majority of people persevere.</p>

<p>At the same time, fidelity doesn’t come with age. Often, older people don’t persevere. If ever that’s the case, it’s because there’s been a focal point of corruption earlier. People did not want to keep struggling. They were not in love enough with their marriage vocation.</p>

<p>Virtues are manifestations of love. When love disappears, all the virtues disappear—and a lot of human things: human talents, abilities, intelligence, big degrees, prestige, well-paying jobs, apostolic successes. These don’t necessarily make us faithful and persevering. We’ve got to work at it out of commitment to the ideals at the beginning.</p>

<p>It would be crazy to worry about whether or not I’m going to persevere in my marriage. We just have to try and live today, try and persevere today, to trust, to hope, to identify ourselves with Christ, and to renew our generosity all the time.</p>

<p>Generosity is a very beautiful virtue. Authentic love leads us to be generous.</p>

<p>We could ask Our Lord: Lord, give me the heart with which you want me to love you in and through my marriage and my family, so that I can “sing a new song unto the Lord” (Ps. 98:1).</p>

<p>The sureness of divine love that is with us is shown in cheerfulness. ‘Lord, may others see God in me—sometimes in my defects, but in the defects in which I struggle.’</p>

<p>Our first loyalty is to God through our vocation—to live out today the duties of my state that God has placed in front of me, and to fight to place myself at the service of my spouse, of my family.</p>

<p>Because that’s what it’s all about: all our formation, all our education has the goal of service, because Christ “did not come to be served, but to serve” (Matt. 20:28).</p>

<p>Often, our beginning again in marriage is a question of beginning again in our service. How can I serve better? What is wanted of me? What can I contribute in this particular moment or situation?</p>

<p>Peter Drucker in <em>The Effective Executive</em> asked the question: What makes people effective? He says it’s because they ask themselves the right question. They don’t just do good things or ask themselves good questions. They do the right things because they ask themselves the right question. And the right question is: What can I contribute? What can I give?</p>

<p>If we can contribute something or give something in this situation, in this family gathering, in this family—even though my family members might be on the other side of the world—if I can contribute something that nobody else can contribute, that makes me effective.</p>

<p>If our children are relatively grown up, maybe our greatest effectiveness is through prayer or being faithful to our spiritual life, and giving that example of virtue, of fidelity, of perseverance.</p>

<p>An attitude to foster can be loyalty even on a human level: to be loyal to people, to be true to our word. “Let your ‘Yes’ be ‘Yes’ and your ‘No’ be ‘No’” (Matt. 5:37).</p>

<p>Fidelity is not staying out of other beds; it’s loving the bed that we’re in, with all of its characteristics. For fidelity, we need an inner toughness to dominate the ego, so that we’re not ruled by likes and dislikes.</p>

<p>Sometimes, we need to burn our bridges to give ourselves, to conquer our addictions, because we’re all addicted to something: our laziness, our selfishness, our football, our fashions, our food, our drink.</p>

<p>There was a story of a man in Mexico many years ago who, with his wife, used to go to the bullfights every Saturday afternoon. For twenty-five years without fail, they went to the bullfights every Saturday afternoon, until one day the wife said, “Let’s not go to the bullfights. I’m fed up going to the bullfights.”</p>

<p>The husband said, “Okay, let’s not go to the bullfights. I never really wanted to go to the bullfights anyway.” There was a man who knew how to keep his first love in first place.</p>

<p>With the passage of time, sometimes our other loves can creep into first and second place, and our first love can get relegated to fifth or sixth place.</p>

<p>Often, we need to rectify, go back, and put more order in things, to recognize that we are vessels of clay.</p>

<p>“We carry this treasure,” says St. Paul, “in vessels of clay” (2 Cor. 4:7). Earthenware vessels. We make mistakes. We put our foot in it. We do the wrong thing.</p>

<p>Difficulties to our fidelity can come from our human limitations—our weaknesses, sometimes our tiredness.</p>

<p>There can be a lack of love. There could be important external changes coming at a bad moment.</p>

<p>Never make long-term decisions, or decisions that affect us in the long term, in a low moment, because that low moment can seriously affect the decision we’re going to make.</p>

<p>There can also be difficulties from temporary blindness, a temporary blindness that can pass. It may blow away by next week.</p>

<p>Our Lord says, “The person who puts their hand to the plough and looks backward is not fit for the kingdom of heaven” (Luke 9:62).</p>

<p>Our goal is to keep our hand on the plough and keep looking forward. The devil often wants us to look back and to turn back. If we keep looking back, it won’t be long before we turn back.</p>

<p>We should try and keep our hand on the plough and keep looking to the future, because if we start looking back, we can start to place conditions on our proposed commitment, when we have committed ourselves to give ourselves completely. Unconditional surrender.</p>

<p>‘Dear Lord, help me not to look back.’</p>

<p>That Palestinian plough that Our Lord was talking about was a difficult plough. It wasn’t easy to direct. The soil in the fields beside the Sea of Galilee was hard soil, so it was difficult to direct and keep your hand on it.</p>

<p>The ploughman has to have a fixed point towards which he directs the plough through difficult ground. If not, he may not be able to open up a straight furrow.</p>

<p>At times, the temptation to look back can come from our own limitations, or from an environment that’s hostile to the obligations we’ve taken on.</p>

<p>Temptation may even be provided by the behavior of others who should be an example and are anything but. Because of the way they live, they seem to tell us that being faithful is not one of the basic values.</p>

<p>At other times, temptation could come from a lack of hope, when we see holiness in marriage as just a far-away thing, as remote an objective as ever, in spite of all of our efforts to keep on struggling.</p>

<p>“After the initial enthusiasm,” especially in the early years of marriage, “there could be doubts, hesitations, anxieties that all begin to take effect” (J. Escrivá, <em>Furrow</em>, Point 133). If we’re forewarned against these things, we can be forearmed.</p>

<p>But we’ve given our word. When we give our word, in a certain sense we give ourselves. We put ‘on the line’ what is most intimate to ourselves.</p>

<p>In spite of our personal failings, a true disciple and follower of Christ will be honest and loyal, a man of his word. Whoever keeps His word is faithful.</p>

<p>There may be a lot of people, irrespective of their age, who seem ignorant of the noble obligation of keeping their word, to fulfill the commitments they once assumed with complete freedom, or to behave in accordance with the decisions they made before God or man, in civil or religious life.</p>

<p>Difficulties may arise, but the faith and the teaching of the Church and the example of the saints that have gone before us can show us that it is possible to live these virtues. God does not deny His grace to those who do what they can.</p>

<p>We must be firmly convinced and help others to have the same conviction: that it is possible to live all the virtues with all the demands that they make.</p>

<p>There is a certain idea that may be in vogue around the place: that virtues and commitments are ideals or goals to aim at, but without much hope of attaining them. But we could ask God that we might never fall into that error.</p>

<p>A Christian who is loyal will not cave in when upright moral behavior imposes or seems to impose serious difficulties.</p>

<p>We can ask God for an upright conscience to be ready to face all situations.</p>

<p>There was a planeload of travel agents who were going to an island off Argentina many years ago for a weekend to explore some new resorts so they could write about it and promote it.</p>

<p>Shortly after takeoff, somebody took the microphone and began talking about how “we’re going to have the weekend of our lives; we’re going to have a great time.” The picture he was painting was not particularly savory.</p>

<p>But then there was another man who tried to take care of his family formation and his spiritual life. He went and he took the microphone after this fellow and said, “Fine, let’s have a great time. Let’s have a wonderful weekend. But let’s just remember also that twenty minutes ago at the airport, we left our wife and our children. Let’s not do anything this weekend that might displease them.”</p>

<p>In just a couple of words, he changed the whole tone of the weekend. We have to be that sort of person, creating an atmosphere of fidelity around us; helping people to live in accordance with the commitments that they have made.</p>

<p>A person who may have a desire in theory to practice a particular virtue—they may not wish to sin, but in practice, when the temptation is great or when difficulties arise that are serious difficulties, they may feel justified in more or less giving in.</p>

<p>It can happen in a work situation, or when we’re faced with the obligation to react energetically when sensuality threatens to intervene, or when we need a serious effort to finance our children’s education, or to be faithful to our spouse or our vocation.</p>

<p>We’re told in Scripture, “The rains fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat upon that house; but it did not fall, because it was founded on rock” (Matt. 7:25).</p>

<p>We have to try and make sure that our marriage vocation is founded on rock.</p>

<p>Mary’s vocation was founded on rock. She and St. Joseph faced all sorts of uncertainties, risks, dangers. But yet they listened to what God was saying to them and everything worked out.</p>

<p>We could ask Our Lady with that great title <em>Virgo fidelis</em>, Virgin most faithful, that we might grow our fidelity to this particular marriage vocation that God has given to us.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

Conor Donnelly</p>

<p>(<em>Proofread</em>)</p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>“He also said, ‘This is what the kingdom of God is like. A man scatters seed on the land. Night and day, while he sleeps, when he is awake, the seed is sprouting and growing. How, he does not know. Of its own accord the land produces first the shoot, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear. And when the crop is ready, at once he starts to reap, because the harvest has come” (Mark 4:26-29).</p>

<p>St. Mark, writing the Gospel of St. Peter, includes this description of this agricultural process, something which Our Lord liked to return to again and again, possibly something that He learned from St. Joseph.</p>

<p>The main message of the seed growing, night and day, “How, he does not know. Of its own accord the land produces first the shoot, then the ear”—it’s a message for us that God’s grace always bears fruit if we do not place obstacles in the way.</p>

<p>Our Lord tells us how the seed grows when it’s planted in the ground. Once it has been sown, it grows independently of whether the owner of the field is asleep or keeps watch over it, or whether he knows what causes the growth.</p>

<p>These words can be very encouraging, because of all the seeds we sow in the lives of our children, in the home, in the classroom, in the school, on the football field, on the volleyball court, on the hockey pitch. Every little seed of virtue that we sow, every little bit of kindness, every bit of encouragement—and children need a lot of encouragement—none of this goes to waste.</p>

<p>Likewise, every seed that we sow in the spiritual formation of our children, and also in the spiritual lives of those around us—the seeds we sow are growing night and day because God’s grace is there, and we know with faith that all of these seeds will eventually bear fruit.</p>

<p>The seeds of grace sown in our own souls are just like that. There might be something we remember that a parent or a teacher said many years ago in the dim and distant past, or some anecdote will come back to us from some Standard Two class or something some uncle or grandmother said, but eventually, it all bears fruit.</p>

<p>If we don’t place any obstacles in its way, if we allow it to grow, that fruit will come. It doesn’t depend on the person who does the sowing, or the person doing the reaping. St. Paul says to the Corinthians, “God gives the growth” (<em>cf</em>. 1 Cor. 3:6-7).</p>

<p>We sow the seeds, and then we leave everything in God’s hands. We pray for the fruits. T. S. Eliot, the famous writer, says, “Ours is only the trying. The rest is none of our business” (T. S. Eliot, <em>Collected Poems</em>).</p>

<p>God is using us as His instruments in the lives of, sometimes, very few people immediately around us, and sometimes in the lives of millions, and the social influence that we try to have by living our lives as upright Christians. God uses this as a great seed in the sowing in the other souls around us.</p>

<p>It gives us great confidence in carrying out our apostolate to consider frequently that, as St. Josemaría says in <em>Christ Is Passing By</em>, “the teaching, the message which we have to communicate, has in its own right an infinite effectiveness which comes not from us, but from Christ” (Josemaría Escrivá, <em>Christ Is Passing By</em>, Point 159).</p>

<p>There’s an 82-year-old Loreto sister, an Irish Loreto sister here in Nairobi, who tells a story of how when she was in a kindergarten school, a missionary came back from Africa and was going around different kindergarten schools, talking about little children in Africa who didn’t know Jesus, and asking the little children to pray for those little children in Africa who didn’t know Jesus.</p>

<p>This six-year-old little girl was very taken with this. Looking back now, she says, “I think that was the beginning of my vocation. Many years later, I tried looking for that priest or finding out who he might have been, because he sowed the seeds of vocation in my soul. He asked us to go home to our parents and ask them if the last decade of the Rosary each night could be for the little children in Africa who didn’t know Jesus.”</p>

<p>She went home to her mum, and her mother said, “No, the last decade is for the Pope, but it can be the second last.” They began to pray the second last decade of the Rosary each night for the little children in Africa who didn’t know Jesus.</p>

<p>Now she has spent sixty years of her life teaching in a school in Africa and running many other schools. The seeds of that priest talking to those little children are yielding abundant fruit. And here we are talking about it almost 100 years later—well, not quite—seventy years later.</p>

<p>We don’t know how God is going to use us, or how He’s going to use the seeds that we sow or the seeds that other people have sown in the lives of people around us, which over time can bear fruit in our own lives.</p>

<p>This can fill us with an awful lot of hope. It can bring about a deep transformation in our souls, because that grace is always at work, whether we are aware or whether we’re not aware.</p>

<p>That can cause us to constantly make resolutions to be faithful, to begin and to begin again, in spite of our miseries or our failures.</p>

<p>St. Josemaría placed great emphasis on that process of beginning and beginning again. He said the whole of our interior life is a process of “beginning and beginning again” (J. Escrivá, <em>The Forge</em>, Point 384).</p>

<p>We fail here, we fail there, we fall down, but we get up again, like Our Lord on the way to Calvary. That doesn’t matter. Grace is at work all the time.</p>

<p>That can lead us to give ourselves more fully and to try to correspond more fervently with the grace that God gives us; also, in the course of our life, to have a deeper hunger for that grace that comes to us in the sacraments.</p>

<p>His grace is acting in us at this moment while we’re praying, while you’re listening to this meditation.</p>

<p>God constantly offers us His grace to help us to be faithful in fulfilling the little duty of each moment. What is God asking of me in this particular moment as I go through the day? He lets us know His Will so that we can become saints by fulfilling that Will faithfully.</p>

<p>On our part, we have to try and accept this help from God and cooperate with generosity and docility.</p>

<p>Sometimes God may permit great crosses in our lives. I heard a story today of a mother who lost a grown-up daughter in some tragedy in another country. She immediately responded with the words, “I forgive, I forgive.”</p>

<p>God can always give us the graces to react in a supernatural way to the apparent tragedies that may take place in our lives.</p>

<p>In our soul as in our body, something similar happens: our lungs need to take in oxygen constantly so as to renew our blood. Anyone who does not breathe dies of suffocation. One writer says anyone who does not accept with docility the grace that God constantly gives us ends by dying of spiritual suffocation (Réginald Garrigou-Lagrange<em>, The Three Ages of the Interior Life</em>, Vol. 1).</p>

<p>Receiving grace with docility means being determined to fulfill all that the Holy Spirit suggests to us in the depths of our heart. He’s always speaking to us.</p>

<p>It means trying to fulfill our duties as perfectly as possible; first of all, in all those things that relate to our commitment towards God, even if we find it difficult., too much, or we fail again and again. We’re like little children learning to walk. They stand up and then they fall down, they stand up and they fall down.</p>

<p>We have those very encouraging words of Our Lord, who tells us: “Unless you become like little children, you cannot enter the kingdom of heaven” (Matt. 18:3).</p>

<p>No matter how difficult we might find the way that God has placed out for us, there’s grace there to help us carry on in that way.</p>

<p>Sometimes we have to make up our minds to acquire a specific virtue that may be, or may seem, out of reach. We try again and again to bear, with supernatural graciousness and simplicity, some setback or other, without losing our peace, without getting angry, without letting everyone around us know that we’re upset.</p>

<p>We try to live out the peace of Christ in all those moments, no matter how long that setback may last or how difficult we may find it. God moves us interiorly, and often He may remind us of the advice that we have received in spiritual direction, because the Holy Spirit is there.</p>

<p>The more faithful that we are to such grace, the better disposed we will be to receive further grace, the easier we will find it to do good deeds, and the happier we will be, because happiness is always related to the way we correspond with grace.</p>

<p>We have to be docile to the inspirations of the Holy Spirit if we are to preserve our life of grace and be supernaturally effective.</p>

<p>As Our Lord tells us in the parable, the seed sown in our hearts has sufficient strength to germinate, to grow, and to bear fruit. Our Lord’s examples can be very powerful.</p>

<p>“The seed is sprouting and growing,” He says. “Of its own accord the land produces first the shoot, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear. And when the crop is ready, at once he starts to reap, because the harvest has come” (<em>cf</em>. Mark 4:27-29).</p>

<p>First of all, we have to enable the seed to reach our heart. We have to make room for it within us, to accept it, not put it to one side, because the opportunities that God gives us don’t wait.</p>

<p>If on some occasion in our prayer or during our spiritual reading, we get an idea, or walking along the street, some idea hits us that’s related to our spiritual life, it’s a very good idea to write those ideas down. Bring them further to your prayer.</p>

<p>Or some advice that you’re given in spiritual direction, write it down. It might not seem particularly relevant at this particular moment. But with the passage of time, the graces of the Holy Spirit and the lights of the Holy Spirit become ever more and more relevant and fruitful.</p>

<p>St. John Henry Newman says, “The opportunities that God gives us…they come and they go. The word of life does not tarry.” We’ve got to catch the wind while it’s blowing. “If we don’t catch hold of it, the devil can bear it away” (John Henry Newman, <em>Sermon for Sexagesima Sunday: Calls of Grace</em>).</p>

<p>Maybe that seed is going to be a very important seed. “The devil is not lazy; rather does he always have his eyes open, and he’s ever ready to spring, and to snatch away the gift that you do not use” (<em>ibid</em>.).</p>

<p>We need to live a series of little things. The little mortification of tidying up after our work. The little effort to get to Confession on the particular day that we have fixed. Examining our conscience in sufficient depth so that we can be aware of where we’re falling and of what God wants us to fight on the next day.</p>

<p>Living the <em>heroic minute</em> in the morning—getting up on time. Changing the conversation or at least keeping silent when someone is being criticized in their absence.</p>

<p>Resistance to grace, says one writer, produces the same effect in the soul as “hail beating on a tree in blossom which gave hopes of bearing much fruit; but the blossom is spoilt and the fruit does not ripen” (Garrigou-Lagrange<em>, loc. cit.</em>). Our interior life can wane and die.</p>

<p>We cannot keep count of all the times the Holy Spirit grants us the grace to avoid deliberate venial sin, and also all those faults which, without properly being sins, are displeasing to God.</p>

<p>The saints are the people who have responded with the greatest sensitivity to that supernatural help.</p>

<p>Neither can we keep count of all the graces we receive to help us sanctify the actions of our ordinary life, carrying them on with determination, with perfection, and with purity of intention, for supernatural reasons as well as for human ones.</p>

<p>If we are faithful from morning to night to the help that we receive, we will have filled each day with acts of love of God and neighbor, at both the pleasant moments and at those times when perhaps we felt tired and had less strength and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>All these actions help to make us effective. One grace leads to another. We are told in St. Mark, “For to him who has, will more be given” (Mark 4:25). The soul is strengthened in goodness to the extent that it practices goodness; it depends on the distance it tries to cover.</p>

<p>Each day is a great gift that God gives us. He wants us to fill it with love by corresponding cheerfully with His grace and by not being surprised at any difficulties or setbacks. He wants us to count on His help to overcome such obstacles and use them so that they will urge us on to holiness and apostolate. Everything is very different when we do it with love and for love.</p>

<p>We also have to try and avoid any discouragement that might arise when our defects don’t disappear and we come to realize that we have failed to acquire certain virtues. Constantly we have to start again.</p>

<p>“A person scatters the seed on the ground when he forms a good resolution in his heart...and the seed germinates and grows without his realizing it, even though he cannot be expected to be aware of its growth.</p>

<p>“Once virtue is conceived,” says St. Gregory the Great, “it journeys towards perfection, and the ground bears fruit of itself because, with the help of grace, a man’s soul rises up spontaneously to do good. But the earth produces first the blade, then the stalk, and finally the ear of grain” (Gregory the Great, <em>Homilies on Ezekiel</em>).</p>

<p>Interior life needs time. It grows and ripens like wheat in a field.</p>

<p>Faithfulness to the impulses God wants us to have is also shown by our avoiding discouragement at our failures and the impatience that comes when we still find it hard to finish our prayer with depth, or to root out a defect, or to think of God often during our work.</p>

<p>The farmer is patient. He doesn’t dig up the seed or abandon the field because he has not found the fruit he expected within a certain time.</p>

<p>Farmers know well that they must work and wait. They hope to have periods of warmth and sunshine, and maybe they hope for rain also. They know that the seed is coming to maturity, “he knows not how,” and that harvest time will come.</p>

<p>In <em>Furrow,</em> Point 668, St. Josemaría says, “Grace, like nature, normally acts gradually. We cannot, properly speaking, move ahead of grace. [ ]{.underline} But in all that does depend on us we have to prepare the way and cooperate when God grants grace to us.</p>

<p>“Souls have to be encouraged to aim very high; they have to be impelled towards Christ’s ideal. Lead them to the highest goals which should not be scaled down or made less lofty in any way.</p>

<p>“But remember that sanctity is not primarily worked out with one’s own hands. Grace normally takes its time, and is not normally inclined to act with violence or irresistible force. Encourage your holy impatience, but do not lose your patience.”</p>

<p>Just as the farmer, with the wisdom of centuries, does not lose his patience, we must learn to aim very high in sanctity and apostolate, waiting for the right moment, without ever losing heart. We will frequently have to start again with our unmodified ambitious resolution.</p>

<p>We need to be able to wait and to struggle with patient perseverance, with the conviction that overcoming a defect or acquiring a virtue does not normally depend on sporadic and violent effort, but on humble constancy in the struggle, the constancy of trying time and time again, counting on God’s mercy.</p>

<p>We cannot, because of impatience, cease to be faithful to the grace we receive. That impatience, generally, can have its roots in pride. “We have to be patient with everyone,” St. Francis de Sales says, “but first of all with ourselves” (Francis de Sales, <em>Letters</em>).</p>

<p>Nothing is beyond remedy for the person who hopes in the Lord; nothing is totally lost. We always have the possibility of being forgiven, and of beginning again; humility, sincerity, repentance ... Then we begin again.</p>

<p>We have to correspond with God, who is determined that we should overcome all obstacles. We can experience deep joy each time that we begin again, and during our time on earth, we will have to do that many, many times, because we will always have faults, deficiencies, weaknesses, and sins.</p>

<p>We must be humble and patient. God allows for our failures, but He also expects many little victories from us throughout our lives, victories that we carry off each time we are faithful to an inspiration, to a motion of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>St. Augustine says, “They are those who, hearing the word, hold it fast in an honest and good heart, and bring forth fruit with patience” (St. Augustine, <em>Sermon 101</em>).</p>

<p>All are capable of giving abundant fruits to the Lord, regardless of their past history. God is always sowing the seed of His grace.</p>

<p>“The most important thing is not to become like a much-trodden path, like outcrop rock, like thistles. … We have to become good ground. … The heart cannot be fair game for birds and passers-by. It has to provide enough ground for the seed to take root. The sun of human passions and a dissolute life should not scorch the seedlings of divine promise” (<em>ibid</em>.).</p>

<p>The three prerequisites for our becoming good ground: to listen with a contrite and humble heart, to be earnest in prayer and mortification, and, finally, to be ready to begin and begin again in the interior struggle. We can’t let ourselves become discouraged if the fruits of our struggle are not readily apparent, even after many years of effort.</p>

<p>“A new heart I will give you,” we’re told, “and a new spirit I will put within you; and I will take out of your flesh the heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh” (Ezek. 36:26).</p>

<p>If we’re willing to change our ways, Our Lord is more than willing to transform us into ‘good ground.’ He will bring this about in the deepest recesses of our being.</p>

<p>The grace of God is all-powerful. The crucial thing is to return again and again to His side. St. Augustine teaches, “God is a farmer and if he abandons man, man becomes a desert. Man is also a farmer and if he leaves God, he turns himself into a desert as well” (St. Augustine, <em>Commentary on Psalm 145</em>).</p>

<p>We can resolve never to be separated from Our Lord and to have recourse to His merciful heart many times each day.</p>

<p>Our Lady, who is the Mediatrix of all graces, will help all those graces to yield abundant fruit in the good soil that she wants each one of us to be.</p>

Conor Donnelly</p>

<p>(<em>Proofread</em>)</p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>“Salt without savor is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trodden underfoot by men” (Matt. 5:13).</p>

<p>Our Lord has told His disciples that they are “the salt of the earth” (Matt. 5:13). They do to the world exactly what salt does to food, keeping it from going bad and making it agreeable to the palate.</p>

<p>But salt can sometimes lose its savor or in itself deteriorate, and then it becomes useless. This kind of change is, after sin, the saddest thing that can befall a Christian, the point of whose existence has been to give light to many, whereas now, in fact, they have become darkness.</p>

<p>Far from being able to point the people he comes in touch with in the right direction, that person now becomes disoriented and aimless himself. Having been placed on earth to give strength to others, he has nothing left to communicate now but weakness.</p>

<p>Lukewarmness is a disease of the soul that affects both the intellect and the will, and leaves the Christian devoid of the strength to carry out apostolate, at the same time filling him with a deep feeling of sadness and impoverishment.</p>

<p>The sickness starts with a weakening of the will, brought about by means of repeated faults and culpable omissions, of frequently doing wrong, and possibly even worse, failing to do what is right.</p>

<p>The Christian no longer sees Christ clearly on the horizon of his life. Because he’s been consistently careless regarding the little details that are a proof of love, he now discovers that Christ seems far removed from him. His interior life undergoes a profound change; it no longer has Our Lord as its focal point.</p>

<p>The person who is lukewarm finds that their practices of piety have become empty of content; he no longer puts his heart and soul into them. He goes through the motions, performing them out of routine or habit, no longer out of love.</p>

<p>One spiritual writer says: “In this state, a man loses all spontaneity and joy—recognizable characteristics of a soul in love—in responding to anything that has a reference to God.</p>

<p>“A lukewarm Christian is somehow ‘inside out’; his is a soul that has ‘grown weary’ in its endeavor to improve. Christ has faded from the horizon of his life.</p>

<p>“The soul decries God, if he sees him at all, describes him as a remote and distant figure, hazy and indistinct, with ill-defined features, and probably indifferent to him. No longer does he perform positive acts of generosity as he formerly did. He is now prepared to settle for much less” (<em>cf</em>. Francis Fernández, <em>Lukewarmness</em>).</p>

<p>St. Thomas Aquinas cites as a feature of this state “a kind of sadness, whereby a man becomes sluggish in spiritual exercises because they weary the body” (Thomas Aquinas, <em>Summa Theologiae</em>, Part I, Question 63).</p>

<p>All norms of piety and devotion become a burden for us, a burden we find increasingly hard to bear, instead of being a powerful center of energy, driving us forward and helping us to overcome any difficulties we may encounter.</p>

<p>There are many Christians who have sunk into lukewarmness. There is, in our time, a great deal of savorless salt about.</p>

<p>We can consider in our prayer today whether we are going forward with the firmness and confidence that Our Lord asks of us, whether we regard our conversation with Him as the treasure which enables our interior life to intensify and keep growing, and whether we properly nourish our love.</p>

<p>We can consider whether, when we become aware of our weakness and our lack of correspondence with grace, we promptly make acts of contrition to close the breach the enemy has made, and is attempting to widen in our defenses.</p>

<p>We mustn’t confuse the state of the lukewarm soul with the sense of dryness sometimes experienced when we perform our acts of piety, a sensation produced on occasions or for long periods by tiredness, or illness, or by the temporary loss of physiological keenness and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>In such cases, in spite of the feeling of dryness, our will is firmly set on all that is good. Our soul knows that it is traveling directly towards Christ, even though it is at this moment passing over a stony waste where the going is hard and we can’t find a single well or even a spring of cool water.</p>

<p>But our soul knows where its destination lies and goes straight towards it in spite of our weariness and thirst and the unfriendly terrain we have to tread.</p>

<p>In the state of what’s called aridity, even though the soul has no feeling and it seems difficult to pray, to carry on any real conversation with God, true devotion nevertheless remains.</p>

<p>St. Thomas Aquinas has defined this type of devotion as the “will to give oneself readily to things concerning the [service] of God” (Thomas Aquinas, <em>Summa Theologiae</em>, Part II-II, Question 82).</p>

<p>This “readiness” grows weak if the will falls into a state of lukewarmness.</p>

<p>“I have this against you,” says Our Lord in the Book of Revelation, “that you have abandoned the love you had at first” (Rev. 2:4)—that you have weakened, that you no longer love me as you did formerly.</p>

<p>A person who is determined to keep up their prayer, even in times of aridity, when all feeling is absent, is perhaps like the person who draws water from a well, bucket by bucket, one aspiration after another, an act of sorrow. It’s hard work and demands effort, but he does draw out water.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in a state of lukewarmness, our imagination strays and runs wild. We’re no longer firmly determined to dispel voluntary distractions and in practice, abandon prayer with the excuse that we’re getting no results from it.</p>

<p>Genuine conversation with God, on the other hand, even if God allows it to be arid, is always fruitful, whatever the circumstances, as long as we have rectitude of intention and are firmly intent on being close to God.</p>

<p>We can remind ourselves, here and now, in the presence of God, that true piety is not a matter of feelings, although sensitive affections are good and they can be a great help in our prayer and in the whole of our interior life, because they’re an important part of human nature as it was created by God.</p>

<p>But our feelings can be mistaken. You can feel very well, and you could have a big cancer inside you. You might feel very sick, and you might be as healthy as a horse. Feelings can be misleading. Christ’s feelings on the Cross cannot have been wonderful, with three big nails going through Him.</p>

<p>And so, our affections should not occupy a disproportionately important place in our life of piety. They’re not the main part of our relationship with God.</p>

<p>St. Josemaría used to say that the day you’re doing your prayer and you feel awful, you feel you’re getting nothing, you feel it’s a waste of time—he said, “Persevere in that prayer, because that might be the best prayer that you ever did, because that prayer is all done for God; there are no human compensations” (<em>cf</em>. Josemaría Escrivá, <em>The Way</em>, Point 101).</p>

<p>If our prayer and our life of piety are full of compensations, it could be that we’re looking for the compensations, not necessarily seeking Him.</p>

<p>Feelings help, but achieve no more than this assistance, because the essence of piety does not consist in feelings, but in the will’s being determined to serve God, quite independently of any state of mind—which is always so changeable!—or of any other circumstances.</p>

<p>In matters of piety, we need to take care not to let ourselves be guided by feelings, but rather by our intellect, enlightened and helped, as we pray it will be, by faith.</p>

<p>One writer said, “To allow oneself to be guided by feelings would be like handing over the management of one’s house to a servant, while you as its real owner abdicate responsibility for it. It’s not the feelings that are bad, but rather the degree of importance that we attribute to them” (Joseph Tissot, <em>The Interior Life</em>).</p>

<p>Lukewarmness is sterile. Salt without savor “is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trodden underfoot by men” (Matt. 5:13).</p>

<p>On the other hand, aridity can be the positive sign that God wants to purify a particular soul.</p>

<p>In our apostolic life, there might be times when we’re asked to do things that don’t give us pleasant feelings. We might be asked to give a talk. We might be asked to go and find material means to set up some apostolic work. We might be asked to do research on a certain topic for some apostolic purpose. And we might find all of those things particularly distasteful.</p>

<p>Our feelings might not be there, but if we approach those tasks with a supernatural outlook and see that as the will of God for us, then great fruits may result.</p>

<p>We need to have interior life. As human beings, we can be a cause of happiness or sadness, of light or darkness. We can be the source of peace or of anxiety, either the leaven that enhances or a dead weight that hinders the progress of others.</p>

<p>Our passage over this earth can never be a matter of indifference as far as others are concerned. We help others to find Christ or we separate them from Him. We enrich others or we impoverish them.</p>

<p>And we come across so many of these others—friends, workmates, members of our family, neighbors—who seem to go after material goods as though they hungered for them, material goods that only serve to lure them away from the true good who is Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>They can journey through life like people who are lost. If the guide of the blind is not to become blind himself (<em>cf</em>. Matt. 15:14), it’s not enough for him to know the way from hearsay, or from coming across mere references to it.</p>

<p>If we are to help the people around us, it’s not enough for us to have a vague and superficial knowledge of the way. We need to walk along it ourselves and to have first-hand knowledge of the obstacles that lie in our path and which need to be surmounted.</p>

<p>We need to have interior life, to enter daily into personal conversation with Jesus. We need to know His doctrine ever more deeply; to struggle with still more determination to overcome our own defects. The apostolate is the result of a great love for Christ.</p>

<p>The first Christians were the true <em>salt of the earth</em>, and they preserved people and institutions—the whole of society—from corruption.</p>

<p>What can it be that has happened in so many nations? Why is it that Christians should now be giving the sad impression that they’re unable to slow down and halt the wave of corruption that’s bursting in on the family, on schools, and on institutions?</p>

<p>The faith is still the same. And Christ lives among us now just as He did previously. His power is still infinite, divine.</p>

<p>One writer says, “Only the lukewarmness of so many thousands, indeed millions, of Christians, explains how we can offer to the world a spectacle of a Christianity that allows all kinds of heresies and stupidities to be propounded within itself.</p>

<p>“Lukewarmness destroys the strength and endurance of the faith and is the soulmate, in both a personal and a collective way, of compromise and of a spirit of comfort-seeking” (Pedro Rodríguez, <em>Faith and Life of Faith</em>).</p>

<p>It’s difficult to explain many of the things that happen nowadays at a personal and public level, if we don’t bear in mind that so many people who should be awake, watchful, and attentive have allowed their faith to fall asleep.</p>

<p>Love has been snuffed out in so very many hearts. In many spheres, the ‘normal Christian’ now generally appears as someone who is lukewarm and mediocre.</p>

<p>Among the first Christians, the ‘normal Christian’ meant someone who lived the heroism of each day and, when the occasion presented itself, accepted martyrdom itself. It could and did mean very often the surrender of one’s very life in defense of the faith.</p>

<p>When love grows cold and faith falls asleep, the salt loses its savor and is no longer good for anything. It’s just something to throw away. What a pity if a Christian were to become as useless as this.</p>

<p>Lukewarmness is often the cause of apostolic ineffectiveness, because if we are in its grip, the little we do becomes a task devoid of human or supernatural attractiveness, and bereft of a spirit of sacrifice.</p>

<p>Faith that appears moribund and radiates little love and is unable to win anyone over or find the right words with which to attract others to a deep and intimate relationship with Christ.</p>

<p>We can ask Our Lord for the strength to react. We will be the “salt of the earth” if we keep up our daily conversation with God, if we go with ever greater faith and love to receive the Blessed Eucharist.</p>

<p>Love was, and is, the moving force of the life of the saints. It’s the whole reason for being of every life dedicated to God.</p>

<p>Love gives us wings with which to soar over any personal barriers to our advance, or any obstacles presented to us by our surroundings. Love makes us unyielding when confronted by setbacks.</p>

<p>Lukewarmness, on the other hand, gives up at the slightest difficulty—a letter we need to write, a phone call we should make, a visit or a conversation that we need to have, or the lack of some material means. It makes mountains out of molehills.</p>

<p>On the other hand, love for God makes a molehill out of a mountain. It transforms the soul, gives it new lights, and opens up new horizons for it. It makes the soul capable of achieving its highest desires and gives it capacities it had never as much as dreamed of possessing.</p>

<p>Love doesn’t make a fuss about the effort involved and fills the soul with happiness as it surveys the results of its efforts.</p>

<p>In the parable of the prodigal son, we’re also told about the elder son. “He was in the field, and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing. And he called one of the servants and asked what this meant.</p>

<p>“The servant said to him, ‘Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fatted calf, because he has received him safe and sound’” (Luke 15:25-27).</p>

<p>St. Augustine comments: “But he was angry and refused to go in. Are you not moved by the celebration in the father’s house? The banquet with the fatted calf, has this not given you pause? No one will exclude you from the banquet. It all is for nothing, however. The elder son becomes furious and will not go in” (St. Augustine, <em>Sermon 11</em>).</p>

<p>In his fit of pique, he reveals his deepest motivation: “Look, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed your command; yet you never gave me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends. But when this son of yours comes, who has devoured your living with harlots, you killed for him the fatted calf” (Luke 15:28-30).</p>

<p>The father in the parable is God. He always has His arms outstretched, being full of mercy. The younger son is the image of the sinner who converts to God.</p>

<p>And the elder son? He is the worker who has labored in the fields, but without joy. He has served because he had to serve. Over the course of time, his heart has grown cold. His sense of charity has evaporated. His brother has become “this son of yours.”</p>

<p>He is like salt which has lost its savor. There is a striking contrast between the magnanimity of the father and the meanness of the elder son.</p>

<p>Serving God and enjoying His friendship should be a continual feast. The Second Vatican Council in <em>Lumen gentium</em> said, “To serve is to reign” (Vatican II, <em>Lumen gentium</em>, Point 36, November 21, 1964).</p>

<p>The elder son represents those who forget that serving God is a tremendous honor. In the act of service is to be found a good measure of the compensation.</p>

<p>“His father says to him, ‘Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours’ (Luke 15: 31). Therefore, all honor and glory are ours if we are really of God” (St. Augustine, <em>ibid.</em>).</p>

<p>God Himself will give us of His riches. What more can we ask for?</p>

<p>“Each one of us must do as he has made up his mind, not reluctantly or under compulsion,” says St. Paul, “for God loves a cheerful giver” (2 Cor. 9:7).</p>

<p>There are always many reasons for us to celebrate if we truly live in the presence of God. We have a special opportunity to be magnanimous in our dealings with those closest to us.</p>

<p>St. Thérèse of Lisieux said, “How sweet a joy it is to think that God is just. In other words, he makes allowances for our weaknesses and understands perfectly the frailty of our humanity.</p>

<p>“So what have I to be afraid of? If God, who is perfectly just, shows such mercy in forgiving the prodigal son, must he not also be just to me ‘who am always with him’ (Luke 15:31)?” (Thérèse of Lisieux, <em>Autobiography of a Soul</em>).</p>

<p>As we finish our prayer, we can turn with confidence to Our Lady, the perfect model of loving correspondence to the Christian vocation.</p>

<p>The <em>Catechism of the Catholic Church</em> says that in Mary we find the model of all virtues (<em>cf</em>. <em>Catechism</em>, Point 829; Vatican II, <em>Lumen gentium</em>, Point 65, November 21, 1964).</p>

<p>Mary, may you remove effectively from our soul any shadow of lukewarmness. May you guide the angels to make us diligent in God’s service, so that we might always be in our family, in our workplace, in society, the salt that God has planned us to be.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins, and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>St. Paul says to the Thessalonians, “For you yourselves know well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night” (1 Thess. 5:2).</p>

<p>Our Lord Himself has said, “I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live. And whoever lives and believes in me shall never die” (John 11: 25-26).</p>

<p>St. Paul to the Ephesians says, “Look carefully then how you walk, not as unwise men, but as wise, making the most of the time” (Eph. 5:15-16).</p>

<p>A lot of these statements in Scripture can remind us not to be blind to our final moment on earth.</p>

<p>The Church in some ways encourages us to prepare for death on a daily basis. Our Lord has said that His coming in glory will take people unawares.</p>

<p>“For as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one side to the other, so will the Son of Man be in his day” (Luke 17:24). Our Lord tells us that nothing can block His second coming at the end of time.</p>

<p>The disciples had a natural curiosity about when and where this would happen. “Where, Lord?” they asked Him. “Where the body is,” He replied, “there the eagles will be gathered” (Luke 17:37).</p>

<p>Our Lord teaches us that everyone will be drawn to the Son of God at the end of time just as eagles converge on their prey.</p>

<p>The same can be said about each person’s moment of death.</p>

<p>St. Paul warns those Christians of Thessalonica that He will come ‘like a thief in the night.” It is one more call to vigilance.</p>

<p>We cannot be blind to our final moment on earth, the day of the Lord, when we will meet God face to face. St. Augustine has written that the Lord keeps the circumstances of His coming hidden so that we might always be on the alert (<em>cf</em>. St. Augustine, <em>Commentary on Psalm 120</em>).</p>

<p>In modern culture, in certain environments, it’s not easy to speak about death and dying. In a materialistic culture, death is taboo because it suggests the end of everything.</p>

<p>It’s easy for people to forget the spiritual nature of man, that every person has a soul and that soul is immortal. It has an eternal destiny. It’s one of the most important truths of our faith, with enormous consequences.</p>

<p>But in a materialistic culture, the very mention of the subject of death can be regarded by some as a sign of bad taste. But it’s the certainty of death that illuminates our life.</p>

<p>The Church invites us to meditate frequently on the inevitability of our death so that we won’t be taken by surprise when it comes.</p>

<p>Pagan culture would have us live as though death were a distant mirage, something that only affects other people.</p>

<p>Regrettably, many who consider themselves good Christians can be unduly influenced by such a seductive approach to life. They’re led astray because they fail to come to terms with the real meaning of death.</p>

<p>Rather than see death as a friend, or even as a sister, as St. Josemaría says in <em>The Way,</em> Points 735 and 739, they view it as an enormous catastrophe, as something that will undermine all their worldly hopes and accomplishments.</p>

<p>I remember accompanying an elderly lady in another country once, at the moment of her death.</p>

<p>I was rather impressed by some of her final words. She said, ‘If I had known death was so beautiful, I would have tried to die a long time ago.’ She was a very holy woman and very well prepared for her death.</p>

<p>This earthbound approach explains why death has to be put in the closet, as it were. It’s too uncomfortable a subject to deal with. Instead of looking upon death as the key to the fullness of joy, the tendency is to see it as the end of the road, the checkout counter on what is for them a kind of terrestrial shopping spree.</p>

<p>These misguided people have lost sight of the fact that every person is in possession of an eternal soul. In <em>The Way</em>, Point 744, St. Josemaría says, “Death is nothing more than a change of lodging.”</p>

<p>The liturgy often reminds us of that truth. In the <em>Preface for the Dead</em>, it says, “Life is changed, not taken away.”</p>

<p>Life changes. It’s not something we’re deprived of.</p>

<p>Christians believe that death represents the end of an earthly pilgrimage. Believers prepare for death on a daily basis.</p>

<p>It’s through the sanctification of ordinary realities that we will win heaven as an eternal reward and the Christian who behaves accordingly will not be alarmed by death’s arrival.</p>

<p>That person will have been patiently readying themselves for this definitive encounter with the Lord. In the words of St. Cyprian, “Death is a stepping up into eternity after we have run in this earthly race” (St. Cyprian, <em>Treatise on Mortality</em>).</p>

<p>In the <em>Furrow,</em> Point 891, St. Josemaría says: “If at any time you feel uneasy at the thought of our sister death, because you see yourself to be such a poor creature, take heart. Heaven awaits us and consider: what will it be like when all the infinite beauty and greatness, and happiness and love of God will be poured into the poor vessel of clay that the human being is, to satisfy it eternally with the freshness of an ever new joy?”</p>

<p>Death acquires a new meaning with the death and resurrection of Christ.</p>

<p>The Book of Wisdom says, “God did not make death, and He does not delight in the death of the living” (Wis. 1:13). There was no such thing as death with all its pain and suffering, before our first parents committed original sin. Death is a consequence of sin.</p>

<p>Man had been given the gift of immortality in the Garden of Paradise. But when our first parents committed that sin, they lost that gift. They lost that gift! St. Paul says, “By the sin of one man, death entered the world” (Rom. 5:12).</p>

<p>The rebellion of our first parents led to the loss of that preternatural gift. By his disobedience, Adam lost his friendship with God and that gift of immortal life.</p>

<p>Since that time, our passage to the house of the Father, our final resting place, takes us to this fateful gateway—the moment when we “depart out of this world to the Father” as quoted in St. John (John 13:1).</p>

<p>St. Paul says Jesus Christ “abolished death and brought life” (2 Tim. 1:10). He removed the essential evil from death and gave it a new meaning, making death into a stepping stone to Life.</p>

<p>His victory is shared by all who believe in Him and who participate in His Life. Our Lord has told us, “I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live. And whoever lives and believes in me shall never die” (John 11: 25-26). Our Lord’s words can fill us with hope, a hope that does not disappoint.</p>

<p>Death is the enemy of the natural life of man. Christ has converted it into our friend and sister. Though the human person suffers defeat at the hands of this foe, he or she can in the end be triumphant thanks to Christ’s immortal sacrifice.</p>

<p>For a materialistic society in which pleasure and comfort reign supreme, death and even life itself are devoid of lasting value. Those who adopt a pagan lifestyle behave as if suffering, failure, and death were curses to be avoided at any cost.</p>

<p>Such people act as if Christ never achieved redemption.</p>

<p>The Psalmist says in his prayer to God: “Those who hate the righteous will be condemned” (Ps. 34:21). But “precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints” (Ps. 116:15).</p>

<p>From her earliest days, the Church has celebrated the anniversaries of the death by martyrdom of her saints. The Church likes to say that these are the <em>dies natalis</em>, the birthdays to that new Life which entails joy without end.</p>

<p>St. John tells us in the Book of Revelation, “I heard a voice from heaven saying: ‘Write this: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord henceforth.’ ‘Blessed indeed,’ says the Spirit, ‘that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds follow them.” (Rev. 14:13).</p>

<p>We know that we will be rewarded for even the smallest service that we have done for the Lord. We’re told in St. Matthew that “whoever gives...even a cup of cold water, because he is a disciple of the Lord, shall not go without His reward” (Matt. 10:42).</p>

<p>We have the joy of looking forward to every little thing being rewarded that we have done for other people in this world.</p>

<p><em>Gaudium et Spes</em> of the Second Vatican Council has said: “For after we have obeyed the Lord, and in His Spirit nurtured on earth the value of human dignity, brotherhood, and freedom, and indeed all the good fruits of our nature and enterprise, we will find them again, but freed of stain,…transfigured, when Christ hands over to the Father: ‘a kingdom eternal and universal...’” (Vatican II, <em>Gaudium et Spes,</em> Point 39).</p>

<p>All the things of the world will perish and be forgotten, but their good “deeds will follow them.”</p>

<p>We can be reminded of that phrase of Scripture which says, “Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where dust and moth consume, and thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven” (Matt. 6:19-20).</p>

<p>Every day, every hour, is an opportunity for us to store up for ourselves treasures in heaven.</p>

<p>Death can teach us many things about life. It can inspire us to live with only what we need, to be detached from the things we own and use, to respect the lasting merit of our good works, and to get rid of superfluous things—many good things.</p>

<p>Occasionally in your family, go through the cabinets of your children or their rooms and help them to make a decision to pass on to others what they don’t need, so that in a subtle way, they get all these messages: they are not here just to accumulate things.</p>

<p>It’s not that the one who has accumulated the most toys wins. Rather, the more we have gotten rid of things and passed them on to others will we be ready for the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p>Death also teaches us to make good use of every day, to have goals, to have a plan for our spiritual life and, also for our professional and material life. Things I need to do today, with priorities, to do number one and then number two.</p>

<p>Ancient writers used to use the phrase <em>Carpe diem</em> <em>(</em>Horace<em>, Odes 1,11,17).</em> Horace, an early Latin writer, used this phrase ‘Seize the day’ to encourage people to make the most of the present moment.</p>

<p>Look around you and see if people on your mode of transport or people that you meet every day are making the most out of every moment. If they have an article or a book they’re reading in spare moments, in the little pieces of time—one writer used to call them the butts of time—the little pieces of time throughout the day when maybe nothing is happening, to have something to be reading, something to be doing, catching up on other little projects or little things to be done here and there. Using our time well.</p>

<p>These words of Horace were a pagan maxim, but we can impart a Christian meaning to it by living each day with joy as if it were our whole life. We can ask ourselves: What is the will of God for me today?</p>

<p>From the things that happened from hour to hour—ups and downs, reversals of fortune, pieces of good news, pieces of bad news—we can decipher what exactly it is that God wants me to do today and try to follow His will with a lot of peace and serenity.</p>

<p>It’s a chance that will never be repeated. Time is like a flowing divine treasure: it comes, it’s here, and then it goes, never to return.</p>

<p>During our examination of conscience, we can please Our Lord with the quantity of acts of love, of our aspirations, of our moments of talking to our guardian angel, of favors we’ve done on behalf of others, of the quiet fulfillment of our duties, of our struggle to be patient.</p>

<p>Perhaps Our Lord will convert these deeds into splendid jewels of eternal worth. “Death ends our time of meriting” (<em>cf</em>. Leo X, Bull, <em>Exsurge Domine</em>, June 15, 1520). Interesting point.</p>

<p>I know a priest who went to see a man on his deathbed. This priest was really renowned for making money, helping people to be detached. He reminded this man on his deathbed: Look, after you die, really nothing belongs to you. It all belongs to God.</p>

<p>There’s not much merit in giving away things after you die. There’s much more merit in giving away things while you are still alive. That way you gain merit—an act of generosity, charity, justice.</p>

<p>We can make a resolution not to waste the days that remain to us in our lives. We do not know when we will die.</p>

<p>Every so often we hear of people dying young, or we hear of accidents, or we hear of people having heart attacks, young people. Those are like little gentle reminders to us from the Holy Spirit that we live in the hands of God.</p>

<p>That very uncertainty helps us to be watchful, like the doorkeeper awaiting the arrival of his master (<em>cf</em>. Luke 12:35-36). Hence the importance of regular sacramental Confession to be always in a state of grace. The Church has always recommended regular Confession.</p>

<p>Our examination of conscience at the end of the day can help us to recognize and discover the failings we may have had this day—failings of charity, of patience, of kindness, of justice, or failings in sensuality, failings in pride and vanity.</p>

<p>Therefore, we can build up those little details that we want to bring to Confession at the end of the week, to cleanse our soul from venial sin, and from any omissions that would indicate a lack of love.</p>

<p>Sometimes our greatest faults or sins could be our sins of omission, or our sins of neglect, things that we could have done and didn’t do, or things that we could have done much better than we did.</p>

<p>Our meditation on death can move us to work more earnestly on the great project of our own sanctification. St. Paul says to the Ephesians, <em>“</em>Look carefully then how you walk, not as unwise men but as wise, making the most of time” (Eph. 5:15-16).</p>

<p>We need to make up for lost time<em>.</em> … Let us take to heart that wise observation written almost twenty centuries ago. Seneca, an ancient Latin writer, said, “It’s not that we have so little time,” he said, “but that we have wasted so much of it” (Seneca<em>, De brevitate vitae,</em> 1,3). He was writing in the early centuries. Clocks and stopwatches had not yet been invented.</p>

<p>We could make an act of contrition for all the time that we may have wasted in our lives and make a resolution to make many wise decisions about our use of time.</p>

<p>We should want to have a long life so that we can give God abundant service. St. Josemaría used to say that if God has invested an awful lot in our education, in our formation, it’s very good that we give Him a good return on that investment. It makes good economic sense.</p>

<p>It’s a good thing to ask Our Lord for a long life so that we can serve more, so that hopefully we go before Our Lord with our arms full. It’s so right for us to love life since this is a gift from God.</p>

<p>I heard of a person once who was involved in fundraising for a center for young people where they would get a lot of formation, growth in holiness, and learn many other skills, and develop their personality, and develop many other virtues.</p>

<p>To try and get his friends to contribute to the growth of this youth center, a center for young people, he said, ‘Look, if you buy a brick in this place, that brick will always be there. Long after you die, that brick will still be there. It would be like an investment for the future. That brick helping that center to form young people will give great glory to God over time and all that glory will be to your benefit at the end of time, at the last judgment.’</p>

<p>There are ways that we can remind people that they have to make good use of their time and also of everything that they have, for that abundant service of God.</p>

<p>We have the grace to open horizons for them, to see those things that perhaps they haven’t seen, so that they also can go before Our Lord with their arms full.</p>

<p>If we’re faithful to our Christian vocation, when the time comes for our encounter with Our Lord we will be prepared to make a tremendous act of love for Our Father God.</p>

<p>What a beautiful thing to die with words of love on our lips. That holy woman that I just mentioned did precisely that. She went out of this world giving praise to God.</p>

<p>“As in one’s whole life, so also in one’s death. Each one should struggle to give glory to the Lord Our God” (St. Ignatius of Loyola, <em>Constitutions</em>).</p>

<p>It’s good to be aware that most people die as they have lived. The concept of last-minute deathbed conversions is very rare.</p>

<p>It’s today we have to live better. This hour. Today we have to practice the virtues. Today we have to live with a greater awareness that there is an end to all this.</p>

<p>St. Ignatius of Loyola says, “May He be honored and glorified. May other people be edified by the example of our patience and fortitude, by the testimony of our living faith, our hope, and our love for the eternal goods” (<em>ibid</em>.).</p>

<p>Our last moment on earth should be spent for the glory of God.</p>

<p>I remember a 19-year-old person dying in a hospital once in Asia and the doctor who was looking after him—this young fellow who had no religion, no formation, no nothing—remarked, ‘He died like a soldier.’ It’s rather a beautiful comment.</p>

<p>We’re called to die like soldiers, but “soldiers of Christ” (2 Tim. 2:3).</p>

<p>It will be a great joy when we give Our Lord the present of our professional work well done; of the apostolate that we’ve tried to do with all the opportunities that He’s given to us; of those many, many details of service to our neighbors, in our family life, in our environment, in our office, in our club, in our neighborhood; to present to Him the joy that we contributed to our family life; and the effort that we made to overcome our defects.</p>

<p>We will leave behind us works that will endure. We will take our departure from this world in a way described by a poet: “I left my love the shore and the singing current. I did not return to the bank for his love, for his love was the water” (B. Llorens, <em>A secret spring).</em></p>

<p>We know that if we live close to Our Lady all through our life, every hour and every day in the presence of Our Mother, she will also be with us. We say so frequently and throughout our life, we have said now, “at the hour of our death” (Prayer, <em>Hail Mary</em>).</p>

<p>There was a lady in Singapore whose husband passed away. But when he was alive, they would go to the happy hour every day in the local pub, and she would put on her earrings and her make-up and they’d go and have a good time.</p>

<p>Then her husband passed away, and she ended her days in a home for the elderly.</p>

<p>She had no religion, but the good nuns were converting her and teaching her the basic prayers, and she learned all of them very well.</p>

<p>During this time, when the time came for the happy hour each day, she liked to remember the good old times and to pretend that she was going to the happy hour. She’d also put on her earrings, maybe some make-up, to pretend she was accompanying her husband to the happy hour.</p>

<p>She learned all of the basic prayers, ready for her Baptism. But she couldn’t quite master the second part of the <em>Hail Mary</em> because she kept saying: Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the happy hour of our death, Amen. But somehow, she had put her finger on the nerve.</p>

<p>We can ask Our Lady to accompany us in that happy hour and to help any people around us also to find Our Lady and to be with her in that very special moment.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

Conor Donnelly</p>

<p>(<em>Proofread</em>)</p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>“If anyone can give so much as a cup of cold water to one of these little ones, because he is a disciple, then I tell you solemnly, he will most certainly not lose his reward” (Matt. 10:42).</p>

<p>Giving a cup of cold water—and notice specifically how Scripture says cold water, not warm water—to someone who needs it is not going to make headlines. Most likely only the giver and the receiver will be aware of it.</p>

<p>And yet Our Lord holds up this small act of kindness as having tremendous value.</p>

<p>Even the simplest acts in which we lose ourselves for others have eternal significance. The cloth of holiness is woven in small details.</p>

<p>With this and with other examples that Our Lord gives to us, He speaks to us about the value of little things.</p>

<p>St. Josemaría liked to say, “A little act, done for love, is worth so much!” (Josemaría Escrivá, <em>The Way</em>, 814).</p>

<p>Mother Teresa has said, “A few words of kindness may be very simple and very brief, but their echoes are endless.”</p>

<p>On one occasion Our Lord sat up to the Temple treasury and He watched people putting money into the receptacle for alms. The scene takes place in one of the porticos, the so-called Treasure Chamber or Hall of Offerings. The days of the Passion were almost upon Him.</p>

<p>Our Lord didn't comment at all on the many people who contributed large amounts. But He saw a woman come up who was dressed in the typical garb of widows, and who was obviously poor (Mark 12:41).</p>

<p>She had perhaps waited for the crowd to thin out before depositing two small coins there. These coins had the least value of any in circulation at the time.</p>

<p>St. Mark explains the real value of these particular units of currency for the benefit of his non-Jewish readers, to whom his Gospel was principally addressed. He wants everyone to know how very little they were worth.</p>

<p>In men's eyes that anonymous offering had very little value. The two coins were worth just a small amount. “That coin,” St. Mark says, “was worth a quarter” (Mark 12:42). It's like a tenth of a denarius, which was the basic monetary unit; a denarius was a day's wages for a farm worker. And so, a quarter would scarcely buy anything.</p>

<p>If anyone was keeping a record of the offerings made that day in the temple, he probably would have thought it was not worth recording that widow's contribution. But we see that in fact this was the most valuable contribution of all.</p>

<p>It would be so pleasing to God that Our Lord called together His disciples, who were scattered around the place, so that they might be taught the lesson to be learned from this widow.</p>

<p>Those tiny pieces of copper could scarcely be heard falling into the treasury box. But Our Lord clearly perceived the love of this woman who said nothing but who was giving all her savings to God.</p>

<p>“Jesus said, ‘Truly I say to you, this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the treasury. For they all contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty has put in everything she had, her whole living’” (Mark 12:43-44).</p>

<p>It often happens that what God considers important is very different from what men consider important. His standard of measurement and ours are not the same.</p>

<p>We are generally impressed by the big gesture, by unusual things of the kind that attract everyone's attention. But God is moved by little details filled with love—"a cup of cold water”—which are within the radius of action of everyone, even small children.</p>

<p>Of course, He's also moved by happenings that we consider to be very important, but only when they're carried out with the same spirit of rectitude of intention, of humility, and of love.</p>

<p>The apostles, who later were to be the very foundation of the Church, did not forget the lesson they were taught that day. That woman has taught all of us to touch God's heart every day in the only way that most of us can: through little things.</p>

<p>In <em>The Way</em>, Point 824, St. Josemaría says, “Have you noticed how human love consists of little things? Well, divine Love also consists of little things.”</p>

<p>In these passages of the Gospel, we learn the true value of these things. We can turn everything that happens, no matter how inconsequential it may seem, into something very pleasing to God. And because it's pleasing to Him, it's turned into something of great value. Only those things that we make pleasing to God have any true and eternal value.</p>

<p>We could consider in our prayer the vast number of opportunities that present themselves to us. We’re told by St. Francis de Sales, “Great opportunities to serve God seldom arise, but little ones are frequent; [and our Lord himself has told us that] ‘he who is faithful over a few things will be placed over many’ (Luke 16:10). Do all things in the name of God, and you will do all things well, provided you know how to fulfill your duties properly.</p>

<p>“Then, whether you eat or drink, whether you sleep, or take recreation, or turn the spit of an oven, you will profit greatly in God's sight by doing all these things, because God wishes you to do them” (St. Francis de Sales, <em>Introduction to the Devout Life</em>).</p>

<p>Often, it's the small things that make a job perfect, worthy of being offered to God: the double-checking of an email or a WhatsApp message that we write, the looking back to double-check on a room that we've just cleaned, or a floor we've just polished, or a table we've just laid, or some little professional job that we have done.</p>

<p>Perfection is in the details. It's not enough that what we're doing is good, whether it's work or prayer or football or hockey or volleyball. It also has to be well finished.</p>

<p>“For there to be virtue,” St. Thomas Aquinas teaches, “it is necessary to attend to two things: to what is being done, and also to the way it is being done” (<em>cf</em>. Thomas Aquinas, <em>Quodlibet</em>, IV).</p>

<p>As far as the way it is being done is concerned, the final touches with the chisel or brush can turn that work into a masterpiece, and Our Lord wants us to work masterpieces every day.</p>

<p>On the other hand, shoddy workmanship, work which is done clumsily or carelessly, is a sign of spiritual laziness or of lukewarmness in a Christian who should be sanctifying himself through his daily work.</p>

<p>We're told in the Book of Revelation, “I know your works: you have the name of being alive, and you are dead. ... For I have not found your works perfect in the sight of my God” (Rev. 3:1-2).</p>

<p>The very nature of our Christian vocation demands that we take care of little things. A teacher who picks up a piece of paper off the floor may give a greater lesson to all his students, or to anybody who happens to be in that particular corridor or place, than all the other classes he may have given in his whole professional lifetime, because with that little gesture we teach the value of order, of tidiness, but also the value of the small things.</p>

<p>Our aim should be to imitate Our Lord during His years in Nazareth, those long years of work, of family life, of friendly relationships with His countrymen.</p>

<p>Doing little things with love for God's sake demands attention, sacrifice, and generosity. A single isolated little detail may not in itself be very important. St. Augustine says, “What is small is small, but he who is faithful in small things is great” (St. Augustine, <em>On Christian Doctrine</em>).</p>

<p>We're told in <em>The Way</em>, “Love is what gives little things their value” (<em>cf</em>. J. Escrivá, <em>The Way,</em> Point 814).</p>

<p>If this love were lacking, our endeavor to look after little things would be pointless; it would become a mania or merely Pharisaical. We would pay tithes in mint, dill and cumin—as the Pharisees do—and we would run the risk of leaving out the most essential points of the law, those of justice and of mercy.</p>

<p>Although what we have to offer may seem very little—just as the contribution of that poor widow did—it acquires a great value if you place it on the altar and unite it to the offering that Our Lord makes of Himself to the Father.</p>

<p>St. John Paul said in one of his homilies: “Our humble surrender—insignificant in itself like the oil of the widow of Sarepta, or the poor widow's mite—becomes acceptable in God's eyes through its union with the offering of Jesus” (John Paul II, <em>Homily</em>, November 7, 1982).</p>

<p>At other times, details in our work, in our study, in our relationships with other people are the crowning of something good which would remain incomplete without those details.</p>

<p>One of the most obvious warning signs that we're starting on the path to lukewarmness is that we give little value to the details of our life of piety, to details in our work, and to little specific acts of virtue. If we ignore these symptoms, we end up paying little attention to big things as well.</p>

<p>“The misfortune is all the more grievous and incurable,” said one writer, “when we barely notice that we are sliding downwards and only slowly come to realize this … That if we are in this state, we give a mortal blow to the life of the spirit, and that can be something obvious to everyone” (Benedict Baur, <em>Frequent Confession</em>).</p>

<p>Love for God, on the other hand, is shown by our inventiveness, by our unremitting zeal, and our effort to find in everything an occasion for showing our love of God and for giving service to others.</p>

<p>Holiness is a cloth woven of little details. God is not indifferent to a love that knows how to care for small details. He's not indifferent, for example, as to whether we go to greet Him, first of all, when we go into a church or when we happen to be passing by a church.</p>

<p>He's not indifferent to the effort we make to arrive on time (better, a few minutes early) for Holy Mass, to the way we genuflect in front of Him in the tabernacle, or the way we behave or try to be recollected in His presence.</p>

<p>There was a man once who tried to do a lot of apostolate in his office, befriending as many people as he could, being close to them, trying to help them in their spiritual life.</p>

<p>He gave a lot of support to people in their marriage, in their family, tried to invite them to recollections, to retreats, to grow spiritually.</p>

<p>But there was one man in the office who refused all of his overtures. He had no time for these sorts of things.</p>

<p>But one day that man came to this other fellow and said, ‘Look, I have a big problem in my marriage. My wife is about to divorce me. Can you give me any advice?’</p>

<p>The original man was a bit surprised. He said, ‘You know, I've often tried to give you advice or reach out to you in different ways, and you never seemed very interested. Why do you come to me?’</p>

<p>The guy said, ‘Well, you're the only one that speaks about anything serious around here.’</p>

<p>The original man said, ‘Okay, let me think about it and pray about it’—which is always a good thing to say to people because they realize you're taking them seriously.</p>

<p>That evening in his prayer, he brought this topic to talk to Our Lord about it. He couldn't really see any great solutions. But for some reason, a scene in a movie with St. Josemaría came to mind, where St. Josemaría mentioned how husbands should try and bring their wives some flowers from time to time.</p>

<p>He was thinking to himself, ‘It's a bit late for flowers. That's not a very prudent sort of advice to give this fellow.’</p>

<p>But that was all he saw in his prayer. With a lot of supernatural outlook, he thought, ‘If that's all I see in my prayer, that, maybe, is what I have to transmit to this fellow.’</p>

<p>But he wasn't terribly convinced himself. It didn't seem very helpful.</p>

<p>The following day, he told his friend, ‘Look, I thought about this, and I prayed about it. My suggestion to you is that you perhaps bring some flowers to your wife.’</p>

<p>The second fellow was thinking, ‘I was really wasting my time talking to you. What a stupid piece of advice. She's about to divorce me and you're telling me to bring her flowers.’</p>

<p>He dismissed his suggestion and went off. But that evening, as he was going home, he was thinking about this and he thought, ‘Even if I get her flowers, I suppose it can't do any harm. The worst thing that could happen is that she might hit me with them.’</p>

<p>So he bought some flowers. When he got home, his wife opened the door and he handed her the flowers. She burst into tears and said, ‘This is the first time in twenty years that you have brought me flowers.’ After that, they lived happily ever after.</p>

<p>Sometimes the little things can make a huge difference.</p>

<p>Moreover, when we see somebody make a devout genuflection before the tabernacle, it's easy for us to think: that person has faith and loves God. That sign of adoration helps others to have greater faith and greater love.</p>

<p>St. Paul VI says, “It may perhaps seem to you that the Liturgy is made up of little things: the position of the body, genuflections, inclinations of the head; the way the thurible, the missal, and the cruets are to be moved. It is then that we have to recall Christ's words in the Gospel: ‘He who is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much’” (Luke 16:10).</p>

<p>“Moreover,” said St. Paul VI, “nothing is small in the Sacred Liturgy, when we think of the greatness of him to whom it is directed” (Paul VI, <em>Address</em>, May 30, 1967).</p>

<p>Our spirit of mortification usually consists in specific little sacrifices throughout the day: keeping up a persevering struggle in our particular examination of conscience, sobriety at meals, punctuality, being pleasant to people, getting up on time, not leaving our work for later even though we find it difficult or trying, having order in our work and taking care of the tools or implements and materials that we use, being grateful for whatever food is placed in front of us, not allowing ourselves whims and fancies.</p>

<p>In order to live charity in a way that becomes ever more refined and heroic, it would be necessary for us to apply this approach right down to the smallest and least important details of daily life.</p>

<p>St. Josemaría in the <em>Furrow</em> says, “Your duty to be a brother to all souls will lead you to practice the ‘apostolate of little things’ without others noticing it. You will want to serve them so that for them, their way becomes agreeable” (J. Escrivá, <em>Furrow</em>, Point 737).</p>

<p>At times it will mean taking a real interest in what other people are saying; at other times it will mean putting aside our own personal concerns so as to give our attention to the people we live with.</p>

<p>A little girl was talking to her father who was reading the newspaper and she said to him, ‘Daddy, you're not listening to me.’</p>

<p>Continuing to read the newspaper, he said, ‘Yes, I am. I'm hearing every word.’</p>

<p>But then she said, ‘But you're not looking at me.’</p>

<p>The child was aware, and the child wanted his full attention. A small thing, but it meant everything to the child.</p>

<p>Care of those little things will mean not getting annoyed about what are really trivia, not being touchy, making people feel welcome.</p>

<p>If those little disturbances come during the day, little things, changes of plans, or funny things go wrong, that can be a trigger to repeat our <em>Morning Offering</em>.</p>

<p>We shall tell Our Lord: I'm really serious with the <em>Offering</em> that I made to you. It's these things I wanted to offer to you.</p>

<p>We will try to help others in a way that they may not notice, or might never find out, but which lightens their burden. We try to pray to God for them when they're in need, to avoid having critical spirit towards them, and always to be grateful to them.</p>

<p>All of these things are within the reach and the scope of each one of us. And we should try and do the same where each one of the virtues is concerned.</p>

<p>If we give attention to little things, we will live each day to the full, and will know how to fill each moment with the sense of preparation for eternity. To do this, we could frequently ask Our Lady for help.</p>

<p>Our Lady, Mother of God, pray for us, now, and in every ordinary little situation of our life.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p>(<em>Proofread</em>)</p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>“Jesus called his disciples to him and said, ‘I feel sorry for all these people.’ Large crowds came to him, bringing the lame, the crippled, the blind, the dumb, and many others; and they put these down at his feet and he cured them. The crowds were astonished to hear the dumb speaking, to see the cripples whole again, the lame walking, and the blind with their sight restored” (Matt. 15:32, 30-31).</p>

<p>We’re told, “Jesus called his disciples to him and said, ‘I feel sorry for all these people.’” This is why the heart of Our Lord is so often moved. In His mercy, He was to follow up this episode with the wonderful miracle of the multiplication of the loaves (Matt. 15:32-39).</p>

<p>We’re reminded in these passages to turn always to the mercy of Our Lord, and to meditate on His life, so as to learn to be merciful to others.</p>

<p>The liturgy places this passage before us during Advent because of an abundance of good things and the limitless mercy which will be the signs of the coming of the Messiah.</p>

<p>“I feel sorry for all these people.” This is an overriding reason for giving ourselves to others: to be compassionate and to have mercy.</p>

<p>In order to learn how to be merciful, we have to fix our eyes on Christ, who comes “to save that which was lost” (Luke 19:10).</p>

<p>He doesn’t come to crush the broken reed or to wholly extinguish the wick that still smolders (<em>cf</em>. Matt. 12:20), but to take upon Himself our wretchedness and save us from it, and to share in their misfortune with those who suffer and are in need. Each page of the Gospel is an example of divine mercy.</p>

<p>We should meditate on the life of Jesus because, as St. Josemaría says, “[The life of] Jesus is a summary and compendium of the [story] of the divine mercy. Many other scenes of the Gospel,” he continues, “also make a deep impact on us, such as his forgiveness of the woman taken in adultery, the parables—the prodigal son, the lost sheep, the pardoned debtor—and the raising to life of the son of the widow at Naim.</p>

<p>“How many reasons based on justice could Christ have found to work as great a wonder as this last one! The only son of that poor widow had died—he who gave meaning to her life, he who would help her in her old age. Jesus did not perform his miracle out of justice, but out of compassion, because his heart was moved by the spectacle of human suffering” (Josemaría Escrivá, <em>Christ Is Passing By</em>, Point 7).</p>

<p>The mercy of God is the essence of the whole history of salvation, the reason for all His saving actions.</p>

<p>God is mercy. And this divine attribute is like the engine supplying the power that energizes the life story of every human being.</p>

<p>When the apostles wanted to sum up God’s revelation, His mercy always appeared to them to be the essence of an eternal and gratuitous plan springing from God’s generosity. With good reason, the Psalmist could affirm: “The earth is full of the steadfast love of the Lord” (Ps. 33:5).</p>

<p>Mercy is constant in God’s attitude to mankind. And recourse to it is the universal remedy for all our ills, including those for which we thought there was no answer.</p>

<p>Meditating on the mercy of God should fill us with great confidence “now and at the hour of our death,” as we pray in the <em>Hail Mary</em>.</p>

<p>What a joy to be able to say to God, with St. Augustine: “All my hope lies solely in your great mercy!” (St. Augustine, <em>Confessions</em>, <em>Book 10</em>).</p>

<p>Solely in that, Lord. On your mercy rests all my hope. Not on my merits, but on your mercy.</p>

<p>In a special way, God shows His mercy towards sinners: He pardons them their sins. The Pharisees often criticize Him for this. He rebuts their criticisms saying: “It is not those who are well who have need of a physician, but those who are sick” (Matt. 9:12).</p>

<p>We who are sinners are sick of soul and need to have recourse many times to the divine mercy. In the Psalms, we say, “Show us, O Lord, your mercy; and grant us your salvation” (Ps. 85:7). The Church repeats these words continually in this liturgical season.</p>

<p>On so many occasions, every day even, we will have need to have recourse to the merciful Heart of Jesus and say: “Lord, if you will, you can make me clean” (Matt. 8:2).</p>

<p>Pope St. John Paul in his encyclical <em>Dives in Misericordia</em> (“Rich in Mercy”), says, especially in these circumstances, “The knowledge of God, the God of mercy and benign love, is a constant and inexhaustible source of conversion, not only as a momentary interior act, but also as a stable disposition, like a state of mind. Those who come to know God in this way, those who so regard Him, cannot live without being incessantly transformed by Him.”</p>

<p>We can also say, as it is said in the Book of Sirach: “How great is the mercy of the Lord, and his forgiveness for those who turn to him!” (Sir. 17:29). Great is the divine mercy toward each one of us.</p>

<p>This can lead us to turn frequently to God, in repentance for our faults and sins, especially in that sacrament of divine mercy which we call Confession.</p>

<p>God has placed a condition for our obtaining His compassion and mercy for our offenses and weaknesses. The condition is that we too should have a heart of compassion for those around us.</p>

<p>In the parable of the good Samaritan (Luke 10:30-37), Our Lord teaches us the attitude that we should adopt towards a neighbor in distress. We’re not permitted to “pass by on the other side” in detached indifference. Rather we must “go” to him.</p>

<p>One morning many years ago, I was going to say Mass in a conference center outside Dublin. It was, maybe, a 45-minute drive. I was a little bit late, so I had my foot on the accelerator. Then I happened to see a car coming out of a side road and hitting a lorry. The front wing of the car was torn off. It was a bit dramatic.</p>

<p>I slowed down. I could see that the only damage really was to the car. Nobody was injured. There was a bit of drama, but nothing else. So, I kept going and I put my foot on the accelerator to try and catch up on the time that I had lost.</p>

<p>But after going about 100 meters, I remembered the story of the Gospel about the priest who went by on the other side of the road.</p>

<p>Listening to my conscience, I had to turn around and go back and double-check that everybody was okay, and give my phone number as a witness, and a few more things. Then I proceeded with my journey a bit more serenely than before.</p>

<p>We can all be that person who goes by on the other side of the road with all sorts of hurried excuses. St. John Paul, in his Apostolic Lette<em>r Salvifici doloris</em> (“The Salvation of Sorrow or Pain”) says: “A good Samaritan is one who stops to relieve the suffering of the other, no matter who he or she may be. This stopping is not just merely from curiosity, but rather from the desire to make ourselves available.</p>

<p>“It’s a specific interior disposition of the heart, which also has its emotional side. Good Samaritans are those who are affected by the suffering they see around them; they are genuinely moved by their neighbor’s misfortune.”</p>

<p>Each of us has to feel bad that people around us do not perhaps have the dignity or the care that they should have as human beings. And it’s not enough for us to feel bad about it. We have to try and do something about it, and infect other people with that sort of thinking, particularly our children, with our words and with our examples.</p>

<p>St. John Paul says, “If Christ, who knows the interior of man, emphasizes this compassion, this means that it’s important for our whole attitude towards the sufferings of others. Therefore one must cultivate this sensitivity of heart, which bears witness to compassion towards a suffering person. Sometimes this compassion remains the only or the principal expression of our love for and of our solidarity with the sufferer” (John Paul II, Apostolic Letter, <em>Salvifici doloris</em>, Point 28, February 11, 1984).</p>

<p>The word compassion comes from two Latin words, <em>com passio</em>, to suffer with.</p>

<p>Throughout Sacred Scripture there’s an urgency on God’s part to see that men also have the stirrings of sympathy and deep-seated feelings of mercy, that they too have this “compassion for another’s misery, which moves us to remedy it, if at all possible” (St. Augustine, <em>The City of God)</em>.</p>

<p>We can look around us and see in our home, in our office, in our workshop, in our neighborhood—is there not some person who’s handicapped, either physically or morally, or elderly, who perhaps needs urgently our time, our affection, and our attention?</p>

<p>Our Lord promises us happiness if we have a merciful heart towards others, and gives assurance that “we will obtain mercy” (Heb. 4:16) from God in the same measure as we show it to our fellow men.</p>

<p>The scope for mercy is as great as the extent of the human suffering that needs to be remedied. And, since mankind is subject to misery and calamity in the physical, intellectual, and moral order, the possible works of mercy are innumerable—as many as men have needs—though traditionally, by way of example, fourteen ‘works of mercy’ have been cited, since in them, this virtue is capable of being exercised in a special way.</p>

<p>Our attitude of compassion and mercy must, in the first place, be shown towards those who are near us—our family, our friends, our close associates—to those whom God has placed at our side, and then to those beyond who are most in need.</p>

<p>Mercy will frequently consist in our attention to the health, the recreation, and the nourishment of those whom God has commended to our care. The sick merit a special attention in terms of our company and our real interest in their illness, as we show them how and help them to offer their sufferings to God.</p>

<p>In a society dehumanized by frequent attacks on the family, more and more old people and those who are ill are left without consolation and affection. Visiting them in their loneliness is a work of mercy that has never been more necessary.</p>

<p>The time spent in keeping them company is rewarded by God in a special way: “As you did it to one of the least of these my brethren, you did it to me,” said Our Lord (Matt. 25:40).</p>

<p>Alongside the so-called material works of mercy, we should also carry out those that are spiritual. In the first place it is our privilege and duty <em>to correct those in</em> <em>error</em> with our advice when the opportunity arises, and charitably, without ever causing offense.</p>

<p>Secondly, it is <em>to teach those who don’t know,</em> especially with regard to ignorance of religion, an ignorance which is the great enemy of God; it increases daily in alarming proportions so that catechesis has become a work of mercy of prime importance and urgency. St. Teresa of Calcutta says ignorance is the greatest poverty.</p>

<p>Next comes giving <em>counsel to the doubting</em>, honestly and with the right intention, so as to help them on their way to God. Then follows the <em>consolation of the afflicted</em>, by sharing their sorrow and encouraging them to recover their happiness in their supernatural understanding of the pain they suffer.</p>

<p><em>Pardon for those who have offended us</em>, promptly and as often as necessary, without giving excessive importance to the offense. We are advised too, <em>to give help to the needy</em>, carrying out this service generously and joyfully.</p>

<p>And finally, we have to <em>pray for the living and the dead</em>, feeling ourselves linked in a special way through the Communion of Saints to those we owe most because of family relationships, or friendship, or whatever else.</p>

<p>Our attitude of merciful benevolence towards others must extend to many different aspects of life because, says St. John Chrysostom, “nothing can make you such an imitator of Christ as your concern for others. Although you fast, although you sleep on the floor, even though, I dare to say, you kill yourself, if you are not attentive to your neighbor, you have done very little; you are very far from being an image of Christ” (St. John Chrysostom, <em>Commentary on the First Epistle to the Corinthians</em>).</p>

<p>We will ourselves obtain God’s mercy and perhaps also merit it for others in that immense depth of “mercy that extends from generation to generation,” as Our Lady prophesied to her cousin Elizabeth (Luke 1:50).</p>

<p>We can also call down the divine mercy on ourselves, who are so much in need of it.</p>

<p>As Christians, we manifest our unity of life by encouraging the works of justice and mercy. Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers...</p>

<p>From the Church’s earliest days, faithful Christians spread the faith to all parts of the world. From those first years too, vast numbers of Christians have “committed their powers and their lives to liberation from every form of oppression and to the promotion of human dignity.</p>

<p>“The experience of the saints and the example of so many works of service to one’s neighbor are an incentive and a beacon for the liberating undertakings that are needed today,” said the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF, <em>Instruction on Christian Freedom and Liberation</em>, Point 57, March 22, 1986).</p>

<p>They are needed perhaps with an even greater urgency than in other periods of history.</p>

<p>Our faith in Christ moves us to be aware of our common involvement with the problems and shortages that other people experience, often with their ignorance and their lack of economic resources.</p>

<p>St. John Paul says this solidarity with our fellow man is not a “superficial sentiment about the evils that beset so many people, whether close to us or far away,” but “a firm and persevering determination to strive for the common good; that is to say, for the good of all and of all individuals, so that we may all be truly responsible for all persons” (John Paul II, Encyclical, <em>Sollicitudo rei socialis</em>–The Concern of the Church for the Social Order, Point 38, December 3, 1987).</p>

<p>Faith leads us to feel a deep respect for others, for each person, and never to remain indifferent to other people’s needs.</p>

<p>Following Christ will manifest itself in deeds of justice and mercy; it will show itself too in our determination to get to know the principles of the social doctrine of the Church and to carry them out, first of all in all our surroundings, right there where we live.</p>

<p>I remember my father coming back from bringing us to swimming lessons as kids. We’d see sometimes a crocodile file of orphans who were going to a local orphanage and were coming from, maybe, the beach as well.</p>

<p>We didn’t know who these people were, what these kids were about, or what was their problem. We didn’t understand. I remember him buying ice cream for those kids, and we were still left with question marks.</p>

<p>Only many years later do you realize what that little gesture was, from a father of a family, in silence, doing that little gesture. It left its mark.</p>

<p>This period coming up to Christmas is a very interesting period, a potential period to engrave these messages in the lives of our children.</p>

<p>It should be possible to say of each one of us at the end of our lives, as it was said about Our Lord: “He went about doing good” (<em>cf</em>. Acts 10:38).</p>

<p>We have to do good within our own families, among our colleagues at work and among our friends, and even with those people whom we just chance to come across.</p>

<p>Our Lord has opportunities outlined for us. There’s a document of the Spanish Episcopal Conference, <em>Catholics in Public Life,</em>which says: “As disciples of Christ, we have to be stewards of fraternity, whatever occasions and circumstances life brings with it. When a man or woman lives the Christian spirit in all its intensity, all his or her activities and relationships reflect and communicate God’s love and the surpassing goods of the Kingdom.</p>

<p>“As Christians we need to know how to make fast and strengthen our relationships each day with our families, our friends, and our neighbors, whether we are at work or at leisure, sealing them with the seal of Christian love, which is simplicity, truthfulness, faithfulness, meekness, generosity, solidarity, and joy.”</p>

<p>We can ask for the mercy of God to be extended to our generation through Mary, Mother of Mercy, our life, our sweetness, and our hope (Prayer, <em>Hail Holy Queen</em>).</p>

<p>Now that the Feast of the Immaculate Conception is so near, our confident reliance on Our Lady will, if we have recourse to her, be more continuous and loving.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

Conor Donnelly</p>

<p><em>(Proofread)</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>We are told in the Gospel, “Can you not buy two sparrows for a penny? Yet not one falls to the ground without your Father knowing” (Matt. 10:29).</p>

<p>Our Lord uses this curious analogy of us with sparrows. It’s curious that He would want to compare us to sparrows, but yet there is a very important message there.</p>

<p>We look at a sparrow, and you blow at a sparrow, it could fall over; very fragile, very timid, not very strong. And yet God tells us that this sparrow can't do a single thing “without your Father knowing” about it and we are “of much more value than any sparrow” (Matt. 10:31).</p>

<p>Our Lord is inviting us in our spiritual life to have a great sense of trust and abandonment. This trust and abandonment, to a large extent, flows from the fact that we are children of God.</p>

<p>We celebrated a few days ago, at the beginning of the month, the Baptism of Our Lord, the institution of the Sacrament of Baptism. Through that sacrament and through all the other sacraments we get divine grace into our soul.</p>

<p>Divine grace is the presence of the Blessed Trinity within us.</p>

<p>Our Lord said we will “come and make our abode in him” (cf. John 14:23), and so when we are in the state of grace, God is in our soul. Therefore, all the fruits of God can be present in our life, in our words, in our actions.</p>

<p>Hopefully, people can somehow detect that this person is trying to lead a holy life, that they're in a state of grace, and therefore God is in control.</p>

<p>If we are not in the state of grace, if God is not in our soul in grace, then the devil may be there. Then all the fruits of the devil can be present in our life, in our works, in our actions, in the atmosphere we carry with us.</p>

<p>Because God is there within us in our soul in grace, we're told in Scripture that we become “children of God” (1 John 3:1). We're told that we're carried in the palm of the hand of a God who loves us.</p>

<p>Therefore, everything that happens to us in our life, we can try to see from a supernatural perspective, and see that God is somehow in control, or He has permitted this particular thing—this joy, or sometimes this sorrow, or this contradiction, or this difficulty, or this challenge.</p>

<p>Or sometimes God can sweep the feet from under us and leave us hanging there. And when that happens it’s because He wants us to learn how to trust in Him, to have a great sense of abandonment like the sparrows.</p>

<p>In another place in Scripture, Our Lord says: “Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap or gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them” (Matt. 6:26).</p>

<p>Our Lord invites us in our spiritual life to have a great sense of abandonment and trust and leave things in His hands. On the one hand, He wants us to use all the human initiative that we have to solve problems.</p>

<p>When He sent the apostles out, He said: “Go ye therefore, teach all nations” (Matt. 28:19). He didn't build chapels. He didn't build schools or hospitals. He didn't give them technology or money or all the other means to fulfill their mission.</p>

<p>He just sent them out with a few ideas. Those ideas were very important ideas, and He wanted them to convert the world with those ideas. He wanted them to be very clear that He would be acting in them and through them.</p>

<p>What He wanted was their faith, their trust, and their abandonment, that He would be at work through them.</p>

<p>Shortly after I was ordained, I was giving a retreat in the south of Spain. (I was ordained there.) There was a number of men on the retreat.</p>

<p>On the first day of the retreat, an 80-year-old man came to chat with me. Usually, people wait a few hours or a few days before they talk to the priest about their resolutions or what they've got from the retreat.</p>

<p>This man came first thing that morning and told me, “You know, I've been attending recollections of Opus Dei for a number of years, and the person in charge of the recollection asked me if I would come to this retreat. I said no, and I had three very good reasons for saying no.</p>

<p>“One is that I train a certain type of horse. There are some people coming these days to buy some of my horses from another country. I want to be there when they come.</p>

<p>“Secondly, there are some people coming to put drains on my house and I've been waiting for two years for them to come to put drains on my house. I want to be there also when they come.</p>

<p>“Thirdly, it's the weekend of the local fiesta, which is a big thing in Spain. Ever since I was seven, I have never missed this local feast. All my friends will be there. It’s a time to catch up. We meet, we talk, we set ourselves up for the next year. It's just unthinkable that I wouldn't be at the local fiesta.</p>

<p>“So I had three very good reasons for telling this man who was in charge of this recollection that I would not go on the retreat. And he asked me again a few weeks later, and again, I said no; and he asked me a third time, and again, I said no.”</p>

<p>But then he said, “I began to feel very uncomfortable, and the only way that I could find any peace was to finally say yes, and so here I am on this retreat very reluctantly. I came thinking about all the things I'm missing, but you know, I've only been here a couple of hours, and already I'm very glad I came.</p>

<p>“Because you see, I've been attending recollections of Opus Dei for the last couple of years, and I keep hearing this idea of divine filiation—that we are all children of God because God lives in our soul in grace. They talk about the life of childhood and spiritual childhood, and I've been trying to figure out what this means.</p>

<p>“Here I am, 80 years of age, and they're telling me I have to become like a child. What does that mean? Does it mean I have to put on short pants or what?</p>

<p>“Now I've come to realize what it means. I have to abandon myself into the arms of my Father God. I've got to let Him call the shots.I've got to let Him make the decisions.</p>

<p>“I've got to try and let myself be like a little child in the arms of his Father, with one hand in the hand of his Father, let God lead me and go where He leads me, irrespective of all the other human or material considerations. I've got to try and do His Will and do His thing, in fact, my Christian vocation.”</p>

<p>In those days, it was as though that man discovered “the pearl of great price” (Matt. 13:45-46).</p>

<p>There are treasures in the Gospel, great spiritual treasures. At certain stages of our life, God may reveal those treasures to us, and those treasures can be worth far more than all sorts of material things, because it's there that we can find our peace and our joy. A peace and joy that this world cannot give.</p>

<p>Therefore, there is great importance in living in the state of grace, of being close to the sacraments, of learning how to savor these great treasures that God gives us.</p>

<p>I heard of a kid once who was walking along the beach and his foot hit against a pouch of stones. He picked up the pouch of stones, and he began to take a stone, and he flung it as far as he could into the sea. He said at the same time, ‘When I grow rich, I'm going to get myself a big house.’</p>

<p>He flung another stone and said, ‘When I get rich, I'm going to buy myself a fine car’; and another stone, ‘When I get rich, I'm going to buy fine clothes’; and another stone, ‘I'm going to have great food.’</p>

<p>One by one, he threw all the stones as far as he could into the sea. When he got down to the last stone, suddenly a little sunbeam or something hit the stone and it glistened. So, he looked again. It was a diamond!</p>

<p>He'd been throwing diamonds far out into the sea, dreaming about treasures that he might never have, but he'd been throwing away the treasures that he had in his hand.</p>

<p>With this story, we have to come to try and realize that maybe we have great treasures in our lives, in our spiritual life in particular, things that we are perhaps not as aware of as we could be. We don't realize the treasures.</p>

<p>One great way of trying to get to know the treasures that we have in our life is through acts of thanksgiving.</p>

<p>If you thank God from the moment you get up in the morning until the moment you get to bed at night, for the fact that you can see, the fact that you can hear, the fact that you can walk around the place and have two arms and two legs—these are all wonderful treasures that can lead us to appreciate all the other treasures that are present every day of our life: the air that we breathe, the things that we see, the health of the people around us.</p>

<p>There are so many wonderful things to be grateful for. So we need to learn how to abandon ourselves into the arms of Our Father God.</p>

<p>I got a haircut last week in Nairobi, and when I came out of the place where I got it, I was driving up the street and saw a young girl crawling on all fours with a little cup, begging. Not something you often see: a young girl crawling on all fours, she had no wheelchair, she had nothing.</p>

<p>The following day, with a friend of mine, we decided to go and look for this girl and try and see if we could do something for her. We found her in a completely different place, purely by accident, crawling across a busy street with several crossings.</p>

<p>So my friend got out of the car and went to talk to her. She had no English and I don't have Swahili. They talked and she explained that she was from Migori. She was 22, she had come to Nairobi two years previously, she lived with two other people with disabilities, and somehow, she had managed to survive.</p>

<p>When she moved around Nairobi, she would hop onto a <em>matatu</em>. She got to different places from which she could beg, and she managed to carry on like this: a very cheerful lady and very happy to talk.</p>

<p>Then she came with us and we got her a wheelchair. Hopefully, she's now using that wheelchair.</p>

<p>But thinking about how that girl has survived in an unknown city far away from her home territory, and not having English, and not knowing the place, and managing to move around like that—there must be a tremendous abandonment in her, in her life, in her spirit. She went away from her own home to a strange place.</p>

<p>So sometimes with people we meet we can learn an awful lot about the spirit of abandonment, trust, of having faith in God, because we know that God has a plan for us.</p>

<p>He wants us to live out that plan. He has a mission for us. There's nothing in our life that He has not foreseen.</p>

<p>And so, as we start a new year we could try to ask Our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament that we might have a greater spirit of faith and trust and abandonment to live out those consequences of being a child of God, so that we may leave the future in His hands.</p>

<p>And if we see, as we can probably do, that when we look back, God has really taken care of so many things in our life: our primary education, our secondary education, perhaps our tertiary education, our work, our family, our children, our health—so many things that God has looked after in all sorts of special ways. We have every reason to grow in faith and trust in Him.</p>

<p>St. Thérèse of Lisieux says, “When…we feel no courage, no energy, for the practice of virtue, this is grace” (Thérèse of Lisieux, <em>Letters of Soeur Thérèse to Céline</em>, October 20, 1888). This is the moment to depend solely on Jesus.</p>

<p>There might be moments in our life when Our Lord precisely sweeps the feet from under us and leaves us hanging there. In those situations, He wants us to look up.</p>

<p>He wants us to trust completely in Him, to leave things in His hands, to learn what real hope is, what real abandonment is.</p>

<p>A farmer told me how one time he was going through his farm, and there’d been a fire on the farm. He came across all sorts of things that had been very burnt.</p>

<p>At one moment he came across a chicken that was very badly burnt, totally dead, and he gave it a good kick—this chicken that was totally dead, burnt black—but out from underneath the chicken ran four or five little chicks.</p>

<p>He said, “I suddenly remembered that phrase from Scripture: ‘I will gather you under my wing as a hen gathers her chicks’” (Matt. 23:27).</p>

<p>He said this hen saw the danger, the fire coming, she gathered her chicks. So he was very aware of the fact that Our Father God looks after us in all sorts of ways, takes care of us, preserves us from danger.</p>

<p>Sometimes we might wonder, Why? Why did this happen to my family, to my parents, to my siblings, to my children, to my work? Why do all these things specifically happen to me?</p>

<p>In certain moments, we may not appreciate that. But when time passes, sometimes we can discover there's some great divine plan behind the cross. God is at work. He has other plans that He's working out.</p>

<p>A man in another country told me once how he had a primary school education. He began to be a salesman selling pots and pans.</p>

<p>He knocked one day on the door of the president of the Ford Corporation who didn't want any pots and pans. He thought he would get his wife, but he got the husband.</p>

<p>But the husband was impressed with his sales pitch. He said, “Young man, how would you like to try selling cars? OK? So come along on Monday morning, we'll start you out selling cars.”</p>

<p>So he sold a lot of cars. He graduated to Mercedes-Benzes. He ended up importing Rolls Royces from London. He could tell you the mileage on the clock of every Rolls Royce in Asia. He made a lot of money.</p>

<p>Then he gave a present of a watch to some man in government, which is something you cannot do in that particular country. The government turned around and bankrupted him.</p>

<p>So he lost everything. He lost all his money. He lost his house. He lost his business. His wife left him. At the age of 49, he developed stage 4 cancer.</p>

<p>That's when I got to know him. He used to go to a support group in his parish for people who were recovering from cancer. This was a fairly well-to-do parish with a lot of wealthy people, and they would get together and talk week by week.</p>

<p>Then they heard of a new drug that had been made in Houston, Texas, a new cancer drug which was very expensive. One by one all these very wealthy people flew off to Houston, Texas to try out this new drug.</p>

<p>He came to me and he said, “You know, it's not fair. There’s no justice in this world. The wealthy can do all these things, and here I am, I’m bankrupt, they’ve taken away my passport, I can't leave the country, I couldn't have any money to fly, and so poor me, I can't try out this new drug.”</p>

<p>And he said, “I was complaining to God for weeks and months about how unfair this life is. Then, you know, the first one died; and then after three months, the next one died; and after six months, another one died; and now they're nearly all dead and I'm still here. So I'm saying thank you, Lord, thank you, Lord.”</p>

<p>So sometimes all the injustices of this world are the things that we find we can do. When time passes and you look back, sometimes you can see, maybe the hand of God was working in funny ways here.</p>

<p>Maybe God has me in the palm of His hand, looking after me in special ways or looking after my family.</p>

<p>There are times when there are things that maybe we'd like to have and we can't have them. God doesn't permit us to have them: luxuries or things that other people have. Maybe it's because God just wants us to trust in Him, to abandon ourselves. He has some other plan. Maybe that's not our mission.</p>

<p>When there are things in life that we find other people have, and we can't afford them and we can't have them, it may be that God is forming our soul at that moment more than at any other time.</p>

<p>Perhaps He's giving us spiritual treasures, teaching us what authentic detachment means, or teaching us authentic hope or authentic trust, which ultimately are the messages that Christ gives to us in Bethlehem.</p>

<p>Christ abandoned Himself in Bethlehem into the arms of Mary, into the arms of Joseph.</p>

<p>Sometimes that's what God wants us to do. If we were to hear tomorrow that we have some fatal disease, we can abandon ourselves into the arms of Our Father God. It can be totally peaceful.</p>

<p>I knew some men a couple of years ago who used to come to recollections like this. Both of them developed cancer, but they were leading very good spiritual lives.</p>

<p>They happened to find themselves in the same hospital room, and one said to the other: “Are you worried about anything? Do you feel bad about anything?” “No, I'm very peaceful.” “Me too, there’s nothing to worry about. I leave everything in the hands of God. It's a great way to live and a great way to die.”</p>

<p>It’s a wonderful thing to be able to look forward to our death because our souls are in the right state.</p>

<p>In the house where I lived, two people passed away in the last two or three months. One was 87, the other was 94. They were both looking forward to their death.</p>

<p>The 94-year-old priest in particular kept saying, “I want to die. I want to die.”</p>

<p>We brought him into the hospital at one stage, The Mater Hospital in Nairobi, and the nurse said to me, “You know, he keeps saying he wants to die, he wants to die, but everyone in this hospital wants to live. We’re wondering, is there something wrong? Is there something we should be doing?”</p>

<p>At one moment he refused all his medication and all of his food. I said to him, “Father, why don't you eat your food or take your medicine?”</p>

<p>“It's the only weapon I have to get out of this place.” So he had a great sense of humor. He died laughing. A great way to live and a great way to die. Abandonment in the moment of death, in the arms of God, because he lived a holy life.</p>

<p>Likewise, the other one, 87, saying his rosary every day, getting to Confession every week, receiving Holy Communion every day. I asked him in the last couple of days before he died, “Is there anything that you'd like?”</p>

<p>“Well, if you could find this dark chocolate, I'd be very happy.” I went to the supermarket and I found the dark chocolate. He liked a particular type of dark chocolate. So he went to heaven, enjoying himself! Great way to live, great way to die.</p>

<p>I have no worries, I’ve lived a good life, I abandon myself into the arms of my Father God, because we have tremendous things to look forward to.</p>

<p>“Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor has it entered the heart of man, the things that God has prepared for those who love him” (1 Cor. 2:9). If we live our lives focused on heaven, it's a great way to live.</p>

<p>We try to make our life on earth as heavenly as possible, but we realize that everything here is passing. It’s worth nothing, it’s fading away.</p>

<p>The things of the spirit, the things of the soul, the things that are worth having—these are the things worth acquiring, the treasures that God gives to us.</p>

<p>We look at little children, we see how they abandon themselves, and how they can get great joy out of little things.</p>

<p>Over the last few weeks, I was involved in a number of Christmas parties for poor kids. I have a friend who organizes these parties, and he gets big numbers. He brings lollipops and chapatis and sodas.</p>

<p>One time we were going to a place, and I said, Where are you going to get the children for the party? He said, You just watch.</p>

<p>So he gives two sodas to two kids. They go away. Fifty kids come within five minutes. So he gives them a lollipop, one by one.</p>

<p>Well, you see the faces of those kids light up with the lollipops and sometimes they have to struggle to get the tight wrapping off the lollipop, because it seems to be there with concrete or something. They fight to get it off. The joy on their faces, the happiness, the little things.</p>

<p>Sometimes God wants us with our childlike spirit to get great joy and happiness out of simple things. It's a great way to learn to be happy.</p>

<p>In the writings of St. Josemaría, you'll find in one place it says, “Be content with what enables you to live a simple and sober life (J. Escrivá, <em>The Way</em>, Point 631).</p>

<p>Great advice. Who do you know in this world who is content—content with what they have, happy with what they have, thanking God for what they have.</p>

<p>A great way to live every day: Thank you, God, for the food we have on the table, for the air that I breathe, for the fact that my hands and legs work, that I can see, that I can hear. So many things that we take for granted too much.</p>

<p>We abandon every day, every hour, in our work, this project, the dreams we have for this coming year, in our workplace, in our family, in the problems we'd like to solve.</p>

<p>Maybe God has precisely given us those problems to work at solving them, not because He wants us to worry about it or be perturbed about it. He just wants us to work at them, but we know that things will work out.</p>

<p>“If you, evil as you are,” we’re told in Scripture, “know how to give good things to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give good things to those who ask him?” (Matt. 7:11).</p>

<p>If you think back over the last few weeks, how many parents in the world did their best at Christmastime to give good things from Father Christmas to their children?</p>

<p>Maybe even if their children didn't deserve them, they still wanted to give them good things, the best they could find. Our Lord tells us, “How much more will your heavenly Father…” It's a great world for all of them.</p>

<p>Our Father God is waiting to give us all the best presents in the world, all the best treasures, but He wants us to trust in Him, to leave everything in His hands.</p>

<p>Every day of our life we can ask Our Lord for an increase in faith, an increase in hope, an increase in charity, an increase in that spirit of divine filiation, that God is my Father.</p>

<p>There may be twists and turns along the pathway of our life, but we know it will work out well in the end.</p>

<p>There was a little girl who asked Santa Claus for a thousand dolls for Christmas. Her father was an atheist.</p>

<p>She got one doll. Her father said to her, “Well, your God didn't listen to your prayer, did he?”</p>

<p>The little girl said, “Yes, He did. He said no. And that's okay. He's my Father, so it's okay for Him to say no from time to time. You're my father, you say ‘no’ pretty frequently also. That’s no big deal; that doesn't mean you don't exist.”</p>

<p>Wow, profound wisdom from a small child.</p>

<p>Sometimes, God might seem not to answer our prayer. Sometimes He says yes, sometimes He says no and sometimes He says, Wait, I’ll give that to you later. Or, Wait, because I have something better to give you, I have something greater off the line.</p>

<p>Or maybe, I don't want to give you that material thing, but I have some great spiritual thing to give you, which is worth far more than you realize, far more than a diamond. Abandonment!</p>

<p>There is a movie that came out about twenty or thirty years ago about a nun talking to a prisoner on death row. This nun is trying to convert this prisoner, helping him to repent and make his peace with God.</p>

<p>The movie is her conversation with this prisoner on death row, and at one stage she says to him: “Did you ever hear that you are a son of God?”</p>

<p>And he replied saying, “You know, in the course of my life I've been called a son of many things, but I have never been called a son of God.”</p>

<p>Well, this great reality can be something that can open our eyes, that we are truly sons of God, children of God.</p>

<p>God is my Father and therefore I can make this new beginning, this new year, with an awful lot of confidence and hope and trust that God is going to be there for me. He's going to work things out.</p>

<p>When we look back over the last year, possibly we can thank God for all the graces that He's given to us in the past year, all the things that are worked out.</p>

<p>A lady told me once how she was sitting in her garden, and she noticed there was a rose in the garden. Suddenly her attention began to focus on the rose, a beautiful rose.</p>

<p>She began to think how man has been able to put men on the moon, but no man can make a rose like that. That was the beginning of a profound spiritual conversion.</p>

<p>She began to focus on all the great spiritual things in her life. She’d led a very busy career woman life up to then. She became a very spiritual person.</p>

<p>In this coming year, God also wants some sort of spiritual conversion inside us, so that we live out that spiritual childhood, that abandonment, in so many ways.</p>

<p>Our Lord said to the apostles, “Do not be afraid.” On many occasions He said those words.</p>

<p>In the face of the supernatural, very often there was fear. There was the storm on the lake when He came walking to them: “Do not be afraid! It is I. Have courage, do not be afraid” (John 6:20).</p>

<p>We can turn to Our Lord and ask Him that we might also respond to those words. Remember that we're worth more than many sparrows and not a single sparrow falls to the ground without Our Father God knowing it.</p>

<p>We can ask Our Lord that we might have this greater spirit of trust and abandonment, the trust and abandonment that we see that Our Lady had throughout her life.</p>

<p>She didn't understand what was going to happen in Bethlehem. She didn't know that they were going to go to Egypt. She didn't know how long they were going to be there. She and St. Joseph were just totally, completely abandoned to the arms of Our Father God.</p>

<p>Mary, may you help me to live that spirit of abandonment in the same way that you did.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

Conor Donnelly</p>

<p>(<em>Proofread</em>)</p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins, and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>“Who in hope believed against hope, to the end that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which had been spoken, ‘So shall your seed be’” (Rom. 4:18; Gen. 15:5).</p>

<p>St. Paul says these words in his Letter to the Romans, referring to Abraham.</p>

<p>Christian asceticism pictures man’s life on earth as a journey that has its end in God. We are all like men on a journey, a wayfarer, longing to turn his steps quickly towards his definitive goal: God.</p>

<p>St. Paul VI says because of this we must all “provide ourselves with hope if we want to walk with a firm and certain step along the hard path in front of us” (Paul VI, <em>Address</em>, December 9, 1975).</p>

<p>If the traveler were to lose hope of reaching their destination, they would not continue with their journey. The only thing that keeps the traveler on his way is his trust that he will some day reach his goal.</p>

<p>As Christians we want to travel very straight and fast towards holiness—to God.</p>

<p>In human life, when a person sets themselves an objective, their hope of achieving it is based on their physical resilience, their training, and their own experience. When all is said and done, it’s based on their willpower which enables them, if necessary, to draw strength from their very weakness.</p>

<p>To reach the supernatural end of our existence, we don’t rely only on our own strength, but on God, who is all-powerful. He’s the faithful friend who doesn’t let us down.</p>

<p>I heard a story once of some people who were out sailing and a bad storm arose, and the waters were coming in, and the waves were coming over the edge of the boat. Things weren’t looking good, and they were a bit stuck.</p>

<p>But then around the corner of the head of land that was close by, they saw a much bigger boat, a trawler, that was heading into the harbor to take refuge. They were able to send a signal to that bigger boat.</p>

<p>They had sent many signals to the land before, but nobody saw them. Now they sent a signal to this bigger boat, who saw the signals, and they realized that the ability of the bigger boat to be able to help them depended on the power of that bigger boat to be able to throw them a line, to be able to pull them into shore.</p>

<p>But it also depended on the goodwill of the people in the other boat, because if they were in a hurry into the harbor with their catch, or they couldn’t be bothered helping these other people, they might have just passed them by.</p>

<p>But they had the power, and they had the goodwill, and they were able to throw them a line, and they were able to pull them into land. And so, they lived to tell the tale.</p>

<p>Our hope in Our Father God is based on those same two principles: He’s all-powerful, He’s able to do anything; and also, He’s all goodness.</p>

<p>Our trust in Him and our hope in Him is well justified. To reach the supernatural end of our existence, therefore, we rely on that goodness and power of our all-lovable Father God. He’s the friend who doesn’t let us down.</p>

<p>His goodness and His mercy are not the same as the goodness and mercy of men, which may frequently be “like a morning cloud, like the dew that goes early away” (Hos. 6:4).</p>

<p>Thanks to the supernatural virtue of hope, a Christian can be confident that he will reach his definitive objective, which already began with Baptism in this life and will remain forever in the next.</p>

<p>This objective is not something merely provisional, not the point of departure towards a further goal, as is the case with ordinary journeys.</p>

<p>The <em>Catechism of St. Pius X</em> says through this virtue, we hope and long for that eternal life promised by God to those who love Him, together with the means needed to achieve it and the support of His omnipotent help.</p>

<p>The greater the difficulties and the weaker we are, the stronger our hope in God has to be, for the greater His help will be. His closeness to our lives will be all the more evident.</p>

<p>In his Letter to the Romans, St. Paul recalls how Abraham “believed in hope against hope, that he should become the father of many nations, as he had been told” (Rom. 4:18).</p>

<p>Pope John Paul I comments: “You will still say, ‘How can this happen?’ The answer is it can happen because it clings tightly to three truths: God is omnipotent, God loves me immensely, and God is faithful to his promises.</p>

<p>“And it is he, the God of mercy, who awakens trust within me; trust which makes me know that I am not alone, or useless, or cast aside, but rather I am a part of a salvific destiny which will end one day in Paradise” (John Paul I, <em>Address</em>, September 20, 1978).</p>

<p>Abraham did not hesitate despite his advanced years and his wife’s sterility. He trusted firmly in the power and mercy of God, “being fully persuaded that God is able to do what He promises” (Rom. 4:21).</p>

<p>And we, “Aren’t we going to trust Jesus Christ,” said one author, “‘who was delivered up for our sins and rose again for our justification’ (Rom. 4:25)? How could God leave us alone to deal with the obstacles we encounter which try to prevent us living in accordance with the call we have received from him?</p>

<p>“He holds out his hand to us in many different ways: usually in our daily prayer, in our fulfillment of the plan of life that we have set ourselves, in the sacraments, and, in a special way, in the advice we receive in spiritual direction.</p>

<p>“Our Lord will never leave us alone on our journey through this world, and on which we frequently experience faintheartedness and weakness.”</p>

<p>A year or two ago there was a story in a newspaper about a family—husband and wife and two children—that were travelling along a road somewhere in Ireland. Suddenly the car went off the road and into a river. Overturned.</p>

<p>The driver, the husband, and the two children were drowned, but the mother managed to escape, even though she made many efforts to try and save the children.</p>

<p>At the funeral of her husband and two children, her family gone in a second, she stood up to speak, heartbroken. She said, “Cherish your family. Your family can be here today and gone tomorrow.”</p>

<p>She also said, “If God has left me, it’s because He has a purpose for my existence.”</p>

<p>There was a woman at a very difficult moment of her life, possibly the most difficult, who had learned how to see that moment with a supernatural perspective, to have hope in God for the future when nothing seemed to make any sense.</p>

<p>Our hope of becoming saints, of faithfully doing what God expects of each one of us, depends on our accepting the hand that He holds out to us. Accepting whatever comes. Seeing this is His will.</p>

<p>Another mother in a school somewhere in Europe was collecting her children from school. She had an automatic car, and by mistake, instead of putting the gear stick into reverse, she put it into going forward.</p>

<p>The car lurched forward and hit a three- or four-year old little girl who was there at that school. She died instantly. The mother of that little girl was standing nearby.</p>

<p>Of course, both mothers were heartbroken. But the mother of the dead child was able to forgive the other mother, who was equally distraught. They had to look forward to the rest of their lives with hope, with peace.</p>

<p>This virtue is not based on our own worthiness, on our own personal situation in life, or on the absence of difficulties, but on God’s will—on His will that we should reach the goal—a will which is always accompanied by all the grace and help that we can need in any possible circumstances.</p>

<p>If God allows situations to happen that lead us to put all our hope and trust in Him, because nothing seems to have worked out, nothing seems to be according to reason, it’s because He wants us to put all our hope in Him, to try and see that there’s some great apostolic purpose in all of those experiences.</p>

<p>It may be that in a week or two, or a month or two, or a year or two, some other person will be brought in contact with us who perhaps has experienced something similar. Because we’ve been there, we know what to say to them; how to give them hope and trust, even when they have to believe in hope against hope.</p>

<p>In <em>The</em> <em>Forge</em>, we’re told: “Though I should walk through the valley of the shadow of death, no evil will I fear. Neither my wretchedness nor the temptations of the enemy will worry me—for you, Lord, are with me” (Josemaría Escrivá, <em>The Forge</em>, Point 194).</p>

<p>So many places in the Gospel show us time and again how God is closer to those who need Him most, inviting us to hope in spite of the obstacles, or the setbacks, or the pain.</p>

<p>He has come to cure, to forgive, to save, and not only to preserve those who are whole. He’s the divine Physician who, above all, cures the sicknesses of the soul.</p>

<p>“Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick” (Mark 2:17). He says this to those who criticized Him for eating with publicans and sinners.</p>

<p>When the things of the soul are not going well, when they have lost their health—and we’re never completely well—Our Lord is ready to pour out more care, more help. He doesn’t abandon the sick person, and He doesn’t abandon us. He doesn’t give up anybody for lost.</p>

<p>He doesn’t leave us alone with our defects, with those things we can and must improve, because He calls us to sanctity, and He has the necessary graces ready for us.</p>

<p>It’s only the sick person who can cause the medicines, and the actions of the Physician who can cure all ills, to be ineffective by refusing to take them.</p>

<p>The saving will of Christ for each one of His disciples—for us—is the promise that we will reach what He Himself asks of us.</p>

<p>The virtue of hope enables us to see that the difficulties of this life have a deeper meaning. They don’t happen by chance, or by blind destiny, but because God wills them, or at least He permits them, in order to bring greater good from those situations.</p>

<p>That approach can help us in all the trials that God may permit in our life or those in the lives of people who are close to us.</p>

<p>That approach can help us to strengthen our trust in Him, to grow in the awareness of our divine filiation, that I am a child of God and carried in the palm of the hand of a God who loves me, in spite of all appearances.</p>

<p>This is the truth. It helps us to see that we can bring about great good from those things.</p>

<p>It can help us to foster a greater detachment from our health and earthly goods, to cleanse our hearts from intentions which perhaps may not be altogether good, and to do penance for our sins and for those of all men.</p>

<p>God tells each one of us that He “prefers mercy to sacrifice” (Matt. 9:13; Hos. 6:6), and if at some moment He allows pain and suffering to overwhelm us, it’s because it is good for us. There’s a far more lofty reason that we at times do not understand.</p>

<p>Fulton Sheen says if God allows hearts to be broken, it’s because He wants to enter into them a little more, wants to make them more Christ-like, to form them, to fashion them after His own heart (<em>cf</em>. <em>Through the Year with Fulton Sheen</em>).</p>

<p>Those heartbreaks are for our own benefit, for that of our family, our friends, the benefit of the whole Church.</p>

<p>God wants our greater good in just the same way as the mother who gives permission for an operation that will enable her child to become healthy again.</p>

<p>It’s at such moments that we have to believe with a faith which is strong and to reawaken our hope, because it’s only this virtue that will teach us to regard as a treasure what humanly presents itself to us as failure, or perhaps as a great misfortune.</p>

<p>These are the moments when we have to go close to the tabernacle and say slowly to Our Lord that we want everything that He wants.</p>

<p>“This is our great mistake,” writes St. Teresa, “we do not resign ourselves absolutely to the disposition of our Lord, who knows best what is for our good” (Teresa of Ávila, <em>Life</em>).</p>

<p>“Jesus, whatever you ‘want,’ I love” (J. Escrivá, <em>The Way</em>, Point 773).</p>

<p>Whatever you allow, I, with your help, will accept as a great good, without laying down any limits or conditions. I will always thank you for everything, if you are close to me.</p>

<p>With a certain frequency, we have to call to mind our hope of ultimately being saints. St. Paul says in the Letter to the Romans that “in everything God works for the good” (Rom. 8:28).</p>

<p>We have to try and repeat that in the depths of our heart, even though we might be passing through a great physical or moral difficulty that possibly seems to have no solution.</p>

<p>A lady approached the Regional Vicar of Opus Dei in Argentina one day to thank him for having given her a prayer card to St. Josemaría. He didn’t remember that occasion; he didn’t remember this lady.</p>

<p>But she said, “Yes, a couple of years ago, you saw me on the street and you gave me a prayer card. At that time my husband was about to divorce me, my children were going through a bad time, I was unemployed, my husband was unemployed. Everything was going wrong in my life and you gave me that prayer card and I prayed it, and now everything has come right.”</p>

<p>Very often God permits everything for our own good. He wants us to try to overcome the way that we may tend towards selfishness, or sadness, or merely trivial objectives.</p>

<p>We’re journeying straight towards heaven, and everything has to become an instrument to bring us closer and enable us to arrive sooner. Everything, even our weaknesses.</p>

<p>We should frequently practice the virtue of hope in all that concerns the state of our own interior life, particularly when it seems that we’re not advancing, that our defects are slow in disappearing, or that we constantly make the same mistakes.</p>

<p>We might tend to see sanctity as something very distant from us; perhaps just an illusion.</p>

<p>We need to have in mind at those moments the teaching of St. John of the Cross, who says that the soul “who has the hope of heaven achieves all that is hoped for” (St. John of the Cross, <em>Poems,</em> VI).</p>

<p>This virtue can be a great driving force in our life. It’s the virtue of people who keep looking up. They don’t look down, particularly in difficult moments. They see the supernatural aspect of everything.</p>

<p>There are people who don’t receive divine goods because they don’t have the hope of receiving them, because their outlook is too human, too narrow. They don’t even glimpse the greatness of the goodness of God who gives us His help, even though we don’t in the least deserve it.</p>

<p>St. John of the Cross says, “To win love’s chase, I took my way, and full of hope began to fly. I soared aloft and soared so high, that in the end I had reached my prey” (<em>ibid.</em>).</p>

<p>Our hope should be in God alone. It should be all embracing, childlike as God wants it to be. Children don’t just believe in their parents. They hope in them for everything that they need.</p>

<p>When holiness—which is the final aim of our lives—seems far away, we shouldn’t slacken in our struggle to come closer to God. We should try to have an ardent hope and to fulfil our duties, day by day, hour by hour.</p>

<p>We have to try and put into practice the advice we received in spiritual direction and the resolutions from our examinations of conscience or our last day of recollection.</p>

<p>We should try and struggle resolutely against discouragement. Some writers say discouragement is the greatest tool of the devil.</p>

<p>At a given moment we may only be able to offer Our Lord the pain and the sorrow that we feel for our defeats—on battlefronts of greater or lesser importance—and also, our renewed desire to begin again.</p>

<p>We struggle resolutely against discouragement. This would be a humble offering which is very pleasing to Our Lord.</p>

<p>Hope encourages us to begin again with cheerfulness and patience, and without getting tired.</p>

<p>We’re told in the <em>Catechism of the Catholic Church,</em> “Hope is the theological virtue by which we desire the kingdom of heaven and eternal life as our happiness, placing our trust in Christ’s promises and relying not on our own strength, but on the help of the grace of the Holy Spirit” (<em>Catechism</em>, Point 1817).</p>

<p>“Let us hold fast to the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful” (Heb. 10:23).</p>

<p>“The Holy Spirit ... He poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that we might be justified by his grace and become heirs in hope of eternal life” (Titus 3:6-7).</p>

<p>“The virtue of hope,” the <em>Catechism of the Catholic Church</em> says, “responds to the aspiration to happiness which God has placed in the heart of every man; it takes up the hopes that inspire men’s activities and purifies them so as to order them to the Kingdom of heaven; it keeps man from discouragement; it sustains him during times of abandonment; it opens up his heart in expectation of eternal beatitude. Buoyed up by hope, he is preserved from selfishness and led to the happiness that flows from charity.</p>

<p>“Christian hope takes up and fulfills the hope of the chosen people which has its origin and model in the hope of Abraham”—who in hope against hope, believed—“who was blessed abundantly by the promises of God fulfilled in Isaac, and who was purified by the test of the sacrifice. ‘Hoping against hope, he believed, and thus became the father of many nations’ (Rom. 4:18).</p>

<p>“Christian hope unfolds from the beginning of Jesus’ preaching in the proclamation of the beatitudes. The beatitudes raise our hope toward heaven as the new Promised Land; they trace the path that leads through the trials that await the disciples of Jesus. But through the merits of Jesus Christ and of his Passion, God keeps us in the ‘hope that does not disappoint’ (Rom. 5:5).</p>

<p>“Hope is the ‘sure and steadfast anchor of the soul...that enters…where Jesus has gone as a forerunner on our behalf’ (Heb. 6:19-20).</p>

<p>“Hope is also a weapon that protects us in the struggle of salvation: ‘Let us ... put on the breastplate of faith and charity, and for a helmet the hope of salvation’ (1 Thess. 5:8). It affords us joy even under trial: ‘Rejoice in your hope, be patient in tribulation’ (Rom. 12:12). Hope is expressed and nourished in prayer” (<em>Catechism</em>, Points 1818-1820).</p>

<p>Prayer is the language of hope. “We can therefore hope in the glory of heaven promised by God to those who love him and do his will (<em>cf</em>. Rom. 8:28-30; Matt. 7:21). In every circumstance, each one of us should hope, with the grace of God, to persevere ‘to the end’ (Matt. 10:22) and to obtain the joy of heaven, as God’s eternal reward for the good works accomplished with the grace of Christ.</p>

<p>“In hope, the Church prays for ‘all men to be saved’ (1 Tim. 2:4). She longs to be united with Christ, her Bridegroom, in the glory of heaven” (<em>Catechism</em>, Point 1821).</p>

<p>We are told in the <em>Catechism</em>: “Hope, O my soul, hope. You know neither the day nor the hour. Watch carefully, for everything passes quickly, even though your impatience makes doubtful what is certain, and turns a very short time into a long one.</p>

<p>“Dream that the more you struggle, the more you prove the love that you bear your God, and the more you will rejoice one day with your Beloved, in a happiness and rapture that can never end” (St. Teresa of Ávila, <em>Excl. 15:3</em>).</p>

<p>St. John Paul II liked to call Our Lady “the Woman of Hope” (John Paul II, Apostolic Letter, <em>Tertio millennio adveniente</em>, Point 48, November 10, 1994).</p>

<p>We can ask Our Lady to help us to cultivate that virtue in a special way every day, particularly aware of the influx of supernatural hope into our soul each time we receive the sacraments.</p>

<p><em>I thank you my God for the good resolutions, affections and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

Conor Donnelly</p>

<p>(<em>Proofread</em>)</p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>“The Spirit of the Lord is upon me. He has sent me to bring good tidings to the poor, to proclaim liberty to the captives, release to the prisoners, and to announce a year of favor to the Lord” (Luke 4:18).</p>

<p>Having said these things, quoting from the Book of Isaiah (Isa. 61:1-2) in the local synagogue in His own hometown, Our Lord “rolls up the scroll, hands it back to the assistant, and sits down” (Luke 4:19). Sitting down was the traditional sign that some important teaching was about to come.</p>

<p>All the townspeople that were there were waiting with bated breath. Suddenly, Our Lord startled them by saying, “Today this Scripture passage is fulfilled in your hearing” (Luke 4:21).</p>

<p>The word which startled them was the word “today” because they'd been trained to look to the future. Salvation was something coming in the future.</p>

<p>But Our Lord talks about “today.” He is here today. He doesn't make a long-range forecast. He doesn't promise that things will be different in the future.</p>

<p>Rather, He claims the power to transform the present, to transform today. There aren't any good times coming. They are here now.</p>

<p>He declares that “the kingdom of God is among you” (Luke 17:21). Something like 80 percent of Our Lord's recorded sayings emphasize that reality, that here and now, this day, God has broken into your life, and He can break into your life.</p>

<p>Here and now is what God counts. “Today all this is fulfilled in your hearing.” Today grace abounds. Today the kingdom of God can be revealed. Today God is revealed behind every episode of your life. Not another day, but today.</p>

<p>As we start this retreat, we could contemplate those words of Our Lord and the importance of this moment.</p>

<p>We’re here listening to this retreat. It's because God has wanted us to be here, listening to this retreat. He's packaged it for you. He has a message for you. The Holy Spirit will speak to you somewhere along the line.</p>

<p>There are things God wants you to hear: eternal truths. Possibly, truths about your own life, truths about the future.</p>

<p>But all that is to happen now, today. Our Lord speaks to us about living this moment very well.</p>

<p>This retreat is a time of grace—a time that God wants us to think, to pray, to change, to make resolutions, and to see how we are living all the other todays.</p>

<p>The retreat is a time to examine our conscience, which really means to examine our life, our thoughts, our heart.</p>

<p>St. Pope John Paul II says there are three fundamental questions that every human person must keep asking themselves in their life: Where have I come from? Where am I going? What is my life all about? (cf. John Paul II, <em>Fides et Ratio</em>, September 14, 1988).</p>

<p>He says that to a large extent, the answers to those questions will determine the happiness that we achieve in this life.</p>

<p>And so, it's important to live this moment well, to realize that God is speaking to us. He has a mission for us. Something to say to us.</p>

<p>An old woman once told a story and she said, “First, I was dying to finish secondary school and start college. Then I was dying to finish college and start working. Then I was dying for the children to grow old enough to attend school so that I could return to work. Then I was dying to retire. And now, I'm dying. I suddenly realize I had forgotten to live each day.”</p>

<p>God speaks to us in the present. He invites us to make radical decisions in our lives, to use our time well, use our life well, discover the mission that He has for us.</p>

<p>He has a mission for each one of us. He wants to place before us the greatest ideals that any human person can have in their life, which are the ideals of Christ. He wants us to think about them, ponder them, go for them.</p>

<p>St. Josemaría in the first point of <em>The</em> <em>Way</em>, from the chapter on Character that has changed the life of many a man, many a person, says, “Don't let your life be sterile. Be useful. Blaze a trail. Shine forth with the light of your faith and of your love.”</p>

<p>These are very dynamic words. He speaks them to young people. Make decisions now because time is passing. Don't waste your youth doing crazy things. It's one of the greatest times of your life. Live it for God. Do good things.</p>

<p>He says, “With your apostolic life, wipe out the slimy and filthy mark left by the impure sowers of hatred. Light up all the ways of the earth with the fire of Christ that you carry in your heart” (Josemaría Escrivá, <em>The Way</em>, Point 1).</p>

<p>He is speaking to every young person on the planet, saying: Do something decent with your life.</p>

<p>In the last few weeks, I had occasion to read about or talk to some very impressive people who did really impressive things in their lives.</p>

<p>There was a Good Shepherd nun in Singapore who ran an orphanage in Burma during the Second World War. I met her a couple of decades ago.</p>

<p>There's another Sacred Heart nun who passed away this week who had a bit of a remote influence on my life as a child in a Montessori school. She then went off to teach English to seminarians in Vietnam, educated some people in China, looked back on her life with great fulfillment.</p>

<p>I was talking to a 95-year-old Kiltegan priest here in Kenya recently who was full of the joys of living, because he feels so fulfilled with what he had done in his life. He spent his time well.</p>

<p>We have a great opportunity to use this retreat to make those radical decisions that God wants us to make.</p>

<p>In a book called <em>Surprised by Joy</em>, C.S. Lewis tells the story of his conversion. He says he was raised in Northern Ireland. He was taught his prayers, but not much religion.</p>

<p>Then he went to college. He dropped out of religion altogether. He had no use for it. He became a convinced atheist.</p>

<p>But despite himself, he was bothered by the grace of today, a <em>here and now</em> tapping on his shoulder.</p>

<p>He writes, “Some days a little door would open to an unspeakable burst of joy. Then it would slam again. The door would open, then it would slam. Open and slam.”</p>

<p>Finally, one day when he was at Oxford, at Magdalen College, something happened. The one who had been pursuing him daily finally caught up with him.</p>

<p>He said, “You must picture me alone in that room in Oxford feeling…the steady unrelenting approach of Him whom I earnestly desired not to meet. … It was in the Trinity Term of 1929 that I gave in, and admitted that God was God, and I knelt and prayed: perhaps that night, the most dejected and reluctant convert in all of England.”</p>

<p>He never became a Catholic, but he talks about his time of grace. “Today the Scripture was realized in his hearing.”</p>

<p>That’s why the Gospel challenged Jesus’ neighbors. It challenges us to live and to be open to the life of Christ here and now. Not tomorrow or next year. Not when the next millennium comes. But here and now.</p>

<p>We can try to live one day at a time as a day of acceptance of what God wants us to do today.</p>

<p>We can try that every day we try to suspend all our judgments of people. Accept them for what they are so that “this Scripture can be fulfilled in our hearing.”</p>

<p>Secondly, look for the opportunity in today—this day that presents itself, even if today is not quite what we have bargained for.</p>

<p>Very often in life, we may be faced with situations or places or events that we didn't quite bargain for.</p>

<p>A graduate student had just gotten his first job, a desk job. He felt, probably quite correctly, that this job was much beneath his talents. He complained to his friend that he didn't do pencil-pushing.</p>

<p>His friend was rather unsympathetic. He just patted him on the back and said to him, “You know, the world is a better place because Michelangelo didn't say, ‘I don’t do ceilings.’</p>

<p>“You don't go through the Bible and find Moses saying, ‘I don't do rivers’ or Noah saying, ‘I don't do arks’ or Ruth saying, ‘I don't do mothers-in-law.’</p>

<p>“David doesn't say, ‘I don't do giants.’ Paul didn't say, ‘I don’t do Gentiles.’ Mary Magdalene didn't say, ‘I don't do feet.’ Jesus didn't say, ‘I don't do crosses.’”</p>

<p>We have to try and look for the opportunity today, even in things you'd rather not do and in places you'd rather not be.</p>

<p>Today's grace awaits you in the particular place where you are. This is the place where God wants you to change, to look up, to see Him acting in your life.</p>

<p>There was a story of a lady who had her husband's new car. She wasn't a very good driver. She was driving to work one day, and another man was driving to work also, and they happened to collide.</p>

<p>There was a little fender-bender occasion. They both stopped the cars and got out to survey the damage. The woman was absolutely distraught. It was her fault—she admitted it.</p>

<p>This was a new car less than two weeks out of the showroom. She dreaded going home to her husband.</p>

<p>The man felt sorry for her. Nevertheless, certain things had to be done. She had to get the license number, the registration papers, and so on.</p>

<p>She went to her car, and she reached the glove compartment to get the documents. Among the first papers to tumble out, written in her husband's distinctive handwriting, were the following words: ‘In case of an accident, remember, honey, it's you I love, not the car.’</p>

<p>The husband put things in perspective. Perspective is the long view of today's grace, maybe today's cross, today's situation, where I'm a bit lost or a bit distressed or looking for answers to questions that have brought me to this retreat.</p>

<p>Today has to be a day of acceptance of the opportunity that God gives me, without fear. Because “today this reading is fulfilled in your hearing.”</p>

<p>God calls us in the opportunity of today to a deeper personal relationship with Him.</p>

<p>There is the story of a Chinese kid who had this big, very decorative, expensive Chinese vase in their house.</p>

<p>One day this little two-year-old put his hand in the big Chinese vase. At the bottom of the vase, he found a coin.</p>

<p>He was pushing and pulling and pushing and pulling. He'd made a grip with his fist on the coin, but his fist wouldn't come out of the neck of the vase.</p>

<p>Then his parents came on the scene. They noticed the child's arm stuck in the vase and they realized he had something in his hand. They told him to let go of whatever it was that he had in his hand.</p>

<p>But he was Chinese. He had found a coin, so he wasn't going to let go. In the end, they had to break the vase.</p>

<p>They broke the vase and when they opened the child's palm, they found he had the equivalent of one shilling. A very small amount of money. For the sake of the one shilling, a very expensive vase was lost.</p>

<p>One spiritual writer says that sometimes, something similar happens in our spiritual life.</p>

<p>We can be very attached to the coins that God has in His hand: the favors I want, help me to pass this exam, help me to get my driving test, help my parents to say yes, help my boyfriend or my girlfriend to agree to what I want.</p>

<p>Sometimes, he said, we're so attached to the coins that God has in His hand, that we forget the hand that gives. We forget the hand of God in our life.</p>

<p>Instead of being so attached to the coins, he said we have to try and reach out and touch that hand, the hand of God in our life.</p>

<p>If you look back over your life, you'll see the hand of God working, who has brought you to be what you are today, who has given you your education, your Christian formation, helped you to be a bit more aware of your Christian vocation, given you so many things.</p>

<p>Now that hand of God is perhaps beckoning to you, touching you. These days of retreat are days of prayer, days of silence, days of formation. God wants us to be silent with Him.</p>

<p>Just like Jesus on many occasions withdrew into the desert alone to pray, to talk to His Father God, to find out a bit more about the jigsaw puzzle of His life, and to find out the plan of God for His life, and the will of God, each one of us has to try and imitate Our Lord’s example and to realize that God has things to say to us and wants us to change, to make resolutions, to make new conversions.</p>

<p>St. John Henry Newman talked about the importance of change in our lives and how God wants us to change often.</p>

<p>Possibly, what we need is a good Confession to lay bare our soul, to let God's grace get in there to the murky deep recesses of our souls that perhaps have not seen the light of day for years.</p>

<p>Or, to get some serious spiritual direction. We all need spiritual direction. Going anywhere in this world we need a coach. Executives need coaches. Sportsmen need coaches.</p>

<p>Anybody who wants their soul to go anywhere, to do anything today, to make use of this opportunity that God has given to them, needs a coach, a spiritual director that they go to regularly to get a few words of advice, to come away maybe with one concrete idea every time from every ten minutes.</p>

<p>If we put those little ten-minute sessions together, over a couple of months we end up with maybe ten or twenty very powerful ideas.</p>

<p>The Holy Spirit works through this means of formation. It helps us to go forward along that journey, that pilgrimage of faith which is our Christian vocation.</p>

<p>All through His life, Our Lord used the word “come.”</p>

<p>“Come, follow me, and I will make you into fishers of men” (Matt. 4:19).</p>

<p>“Master, where do you live?” “Come and see” (John 1:38-39).</p>

<p>“Come to me, all you who labor and are heavy burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you…my yoke is easy, my burden is light” (Matt. 11:28-30).</p>

<p>Our Lord all the time is saying “come.” Come to a new divine intimacy. That's what this retreat is all about.</p>

<p>It's only at the end of His life that He says “go.” “Go you, therefore, teach all nations” (Matt. 28:19).</p>

<p>We have to “come” before we “go.” This retreat is all about the coming.</p>

<p>God wants us to grow spiritually. He has planted a seed in our soul at baptism. He wants it to germinate. He gives it the fertilizer of His grace of formation.</p>

<p>Of course, when you put fertilizer on a plant, on a rose bush or some other plant, you don't see it sprouting up in front of your eyes and producing a wonderful fruit or a wonderful flower. It takes time.</p>

<p>Good wine improves with time. God wants our souls to improve with time. He may have great things prepared for us, just like he had great things prepared in and through the very special life of Joseph, his very ordinary life<strong>.</strong></p>

<p>We have to try and examine our conscience and see what areas of our life need conversion.</p>

<p>Do we get drunk? Are we doing drugs? Are we indulging in things we shouldn't be indulging in? Are we a little bit too lazy? Lacking in order? Lacking in charity? Lacking in respect for other people? Lacking in honesty or integrity?</p>

<p>There was a man who was a little bit too drunk, who was coming home from a few too many drinks one night. He happened to spot a rusty nail on the ground.</p>

<p>It was a twisted, bent, rusty nail. It caught his attention, and so he bent down to pick it up. It took him a few goes before he could pick it up because he was very unsteady on his feet, but finally, he got it.</p>

<p>He was thinking: If I could straighten this out and remove the rust, it could be useful some day.</p>

<p>When he sobered up a day or so later, he began to straighten out the nail and he began to get rid of the rust with some sandpaper. As he was working on the nail, the Holy Spirit was working on his soul.</p>

<p>He began to see, “Really my life, my soul, I'm a bit like this rusty nail. What I need to do is to straighten myself out a little bit. Just like I'm straightening out this nail, I need to straighten out my life, straighten out my soul, my conscience.”</p>

<p>He realized he needed to go to a good Confession. Maybe, start a new practice of regular Confession to let the grace of God circulate in his soul.</p>

<p>Sometimes the Holy Spirit works in funny ways—leads us back to God or leads us to see things with greater clarity, things in our life that we need to straighten out, things that are not as they should be.</p>

<p>Maybe He bothers our conscience a little bit. But God also wants us to want that new change and that new conversion, to want it 100 percent.</p>

<p>There was a story of a thief who decided to go to Confession to a priest. He was a pickpocket and he wanted to confess his sins.</p>

<p>He went to confess his sins to the priest face to face. In the course of the Confession, he stole the watch of the priest. He was really an expert pickpocket.</p>

<p>At the end of the Confession, when the priest said, “Is there anything else?” he said, “Oh yes, Father, I forgot. I stole a watch.”</p>

<p>The priest said, “Well, you have to give it back.”</p>

<p>The thief said, “Father, that will be a little bit difficult. But I tell you what, I will give it to you.”</p>

<p>The priest said, “I don't want it—you've got to give it back to the owner.”</p>

<p>The thief said, “The owner doesn't want it.”</p>

<p>The priest said, “In that case, you may keep it.” The thief ended up with the watch of the priest.</p>

<p>One thing you could say about that interchange was that that guy was not very sincere. He really didn't want to change his life.</p>

<p>We can't be sorry for our sins if we're not willing to change our lives. The <em>purpose</em> <em>of</em> <em>amendment</em> has to be present in our Confession.</p>

<p>If a person goes to the priest and says, “Father, I killed fifty people last week, and if I get a chance, I'll kill another fifty next week” the priest will say, “You have to go and try and change your contrition. You have to be ready to amend your life, to change your life.”</p>

<p>Similarly, if a person comes and says, “Father, I'm using contraception” the priest has to say, “Are you willing to stop using contraception before I can give you absolution?”</p>

<p>Or “Are you willing to stop stealing?” “Are you willing to stop getting drunk?” Whatever it is, here and now, we have to be willing to change our lives.</p>

<p>That doesn't mean that I will never take a drink again for the rest of my life, or I will never kill somebody again. But here and now, I want to change my life. That is enough to get a valid absolution because that's valid contrition.</p>

<p>In Scripture, we find the Psalm saying to Our Lord, “Create a new heart in me, O God” (Ps. 51:10).</p>

<p>We come to the retreat to get a new heart. “Take out this heart of stone and give me a heart of flesh” (cf. Ezek. 36:26).</p>

<p>“A humble and contrite heart, O Lord, you will not spurn” (Ps. 51:17).</p>

<p>It has a great importance in our faith in the heart. We get a new heart by washing our souls and our hearts in the waters of Confession. The grace of God flows there and washes away our sins.</p>

<p>But we have to first of all realize that there is something there that needs to be changed.</p>

<p>There is a story of an Irish priest one time whose congregation had a lot of problems with alcoholism. He tried to give a very graphic sermon.</p>

<p>He brought a bottle of whiskey to the pulpit and also a live worm. Then in the sermon, he dropped the live worm into the whiskey.</p>

<p>He said, “I’m going to show you what this whiskey does to this worm.” The worm shriveled up and died because of the acidic nature of the whiskey. “You see, this is what the whiskey does to your insides.”</p>

<p>After the homily, he was very happy with himself; things had gone very well.</p>

<p>But back in the sacristy when he was divesting, a man came into the sacristy and said, “Father, I wonder if I could have the bottle of whiskey because, you see, I'm full of worms.”</p>

<p>One thing you can say about that man is that he was honest. He knew his insides very well. He knew his problems. He knew his weaknesses. He knew his illnesses. He knew what was there deep down inside him.</p>

<p>In the course of our retreat and of our life, we have to try and discover those deep-down things that need changing. God wants us to see them.</p>

<p>He wants us to make resolutions to change them because he wants us to be better, because that's what holiness is all about.</p>

<p>There was a farmer who had to go out to hunt for food for his family. He had three bullets in his rifle. He saw a rabbit. He shot and he missed. Then he saw a fox, and he shot and he missed.</p>

<p>And then he saw a big fat turkey up in a tree. He lifted the rifle to shoot the turkey. But then the voice of conscience deep inside him said: “Aim high, pray first, stay focused.”</p>

<p>As he was about to shoot the turkey, out of the corner of his eye he saw a deer. The deer had more meat than the turkey, so he lowered the rifle to shoot the deer. Then he heard the voice of conscience again: “Aim high, pray first, stay focused.”</p>

<p>Then he saw there was a rattlesnake between his feet and that posed the greatest danger to life and limb. He was about to shoot the rattlesnake, but then he heard the voice of conscience again saying to him: “Aim high, pray first, stay focused.”</p>

<p>He lifted up the rifle to shoot the turkey. He thought he better obey the voice of conscience. He shot the turkey. The bullet ricocheted off a bone in the turkey, hitting the deer and killing the deer.</p>

<p>The impact of shooting the rifle made him lose his balance and he stood on the snake, killed it, and fell backwards into a pond that was full of fish.</p>

<p>When he stood up from the pond, he had a dead turkey, a dead deer, a dead snake, and plenty of fish with which to feed his family.</p>

<p>The moral of the story is that we have to aim high, pray first, stay focused.</p>

<p>We could ask Our Lady that in this retreat, we might use our time well, reading good things, praying a lot, listening to the Holy Spirit, letting God speak to us, because He probably wants a new conversion from us these days. Because “today the Scripture has been fulfilled in our hearing.”</p>

<p>Mary, may you help us to make the changes to our lives that you want us to make.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

Conor Donnelly</p>

<p>(<em>Proofread</em>)</p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>“My dear friends,” we are told in St. John, “we are already God’s children, but what we shall be in the future has not yet been revealed. We are well aware that when he appears we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he really is. Whoever treasures this hope of him purifies himself, to be pure as he is” (1 John 3:2-3).</p>

<p>Today we celebrate the Feast of All the Saints, a feast of all those who have gone before us and who are now happy in heaven.</p>

<p>In many ways, the goal of our life is to be a November 1 saint, not necessarily to have a feast day assigned to us, but to be one of those immense numbers of people in heaven, enjoying the company of God forever.</p>

<p>“Blessed are you when people abuse you and persecute you and speak all kinds of calumny against you falsely on my account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward will be great in heaven; this is how they persecuted the prophets before you” (Matt. 5:11-12).</p>

<p>Today is a day of joy, and also a day of hope—a day of joy and hope because we look forward to the eternal wedding feast to which God has called us, which will bring us great joys. “Your reward will be great in heaven.”</p>

<p>St. Josemaría in <em>The Way</em> says, “Foster in your heart the glorious hope of heaven” (Josemaría Escrivá, <em>The Way</em>, Point 668).</p>

<p>“What does it matter,” he says, “if we suffer in this world for ten, twenty, thirty, forty years...if afterwards there is heaven forever and forever and forever?” (<em>ibid</em>., Point 182).</p>

<p>Heaven makes everything worthwhile. We can look forward to that great reality where “eyes have not seen, nor ears heard, nor has it entered into the heart of man the things that God has prepared for those who love him” (1 Corinthians 2:9).</p>

<p>Today we celebrate those who have fought the good fight, who have finished the race (<em>cf</em>. 2 Tim. 4:7), who communicate to us a message that is worthwhile: Keep on struggling. “Be you perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect” (Matt. 5:48).</p>

<p>“You must see,” said St. John, “what great love the Father has lavished on us by letting us be called God’s children, which is what we are. The reason why the world does not acknowledge us is that it did not acknowledge him” (1 John 3:1).</p>

<p>In the Beatitudes Our Lord encourages us to walk along a certain pathway, which is the pathway to heaven, to be poor of spirit, to be gentle, to hunger and thirst for righteousness, to be merciful, to be pure in heart, to be a peacemaker. All these things He suggests to us as beautiful realities.</p>

<p>A lady told me once how in the Old Testament God gave us the commandments, but in the New Testament, He gave us the Beatitudes. It’s like a loving Father speaking to His children. Commandments are like a Creator speaking to those He has created.</p>

<p>Ultimately the message of today’s feast day is that sanctity is within reach of everyone.</p>

<p>And we know, we’ve heard, from the Second Vatican Council and so many other ways, that everyone is called to holiness. The <em>Entrance Antiphon</em> of today’s Mass says: “Let us all rejoice in the Lord and keep festival in honor of all the saints. Let us join with the angels in joyful praise to the Son of God.”</p>

<p>We’re also reminded today and tomorrow of the Communion of Saints, how we are united in the Church.</p>

<p>The Church has different parts, just like the human body. There’s the <em>Church suffering</em> in purgatory; there’s the <em>Church triumphant</em>in heaven; the <em>Church militant</em> here on earth, struggling, fighting.</p>

<p>The Blessed in heaven, we know, can help us here on earth. The truth of our faith is that those who have gone before us, who have a special relationship with us, continue with their particular concern for each one of us from heaven.</p>

<p>Our parents, our loved ones, we know, follow us very closely. Somebody said once, the distance between heaven and earth is really very small.</p>

<p>The <em>Preface</em> of today’s Mass says: “Around your throne, the saints sing your praise forever. Their glory fills us with joy.”</p>

<p>And Our Lord reminds us of the rewards for our fidelity. “Blessed are you, for I was hungry and you gave me to eat. I was thirsty and you gave me to drink” (Matt. 25:35).</p>

<p>No small thing that we do on this earth for others and for God will be forgotten in the eyes of God.</p>

<p>St. Josemaría reminds us that all the little things we may have done in the past, our guardian angel has taken note, and on the day of judgment, he will bring out all those good deeds from his files.</p>

<p>We’re encouraged because the difficulties, the miseries, the crosses—we realize these are all the pathway to holiness.</p>

<p>The saints were normal people, not superbeings. But often they did have a heroic correspondence to the graces that God gave them. Somehow, they took very seriously that phrase of Scripture: “This is the will of God, your sanctification” (1 Thess. 4:3).</p>

<p>Stories of fidelity are always very beautiful and very moving, and can be very inspiring for us.</p>

<p>We are called to the fullness of love, and we’re reminded today that sanctity is accessible to everyone in all sorts of jobs and situations. Nobody is excluded.</p>

<p>There was a document of the Holy See that was being prepared in the 1940s that began to open up to the idea that people could be holy in the world. It’s mentioned in a book called <em>The Canonical Path of Opus Dei</em>.</p>

<p>That document mentioned how people could be holy in most professions, but not in anything relating to commerce or finance.</p>

<p>In the succeeding twenty years, before the Second Vatican Council, the Holy Spirit worked a bit more, and we came to the great teaching of the Council about the <em>universal call to holiness</em>. There are no limits to where we can be holy, which walks of life can be holy here on earth.</p>

<p>This Feast of All the Saints has been celebrated since the eighth century. There’s a great tradition in the Church of celebrating the saints.</p>

<p>In <em>The Forge</em>, we’re told, “It seems an excellent idea to me that you should tell the Lord often about your great and ardent desire to be a saint, even though you see yourself filled with wretchedness...—Tell him, precisely because of this!” (J. Escrivá, <em>The Forge</em>, Point 419).</p>

<p>Our sights are lifted up onto great goals, great ideals. We’re reminded that it’s not enough to be nice people, good guys. God wants us to be saints.</p>

<p>St. Josemaría used to say to his children, “I love you very much, but I want you to be holy.” There was a play on the word <em>querer</em>, to love in Spanish, and to want. “I love you very much, but I want you to be holy.”</p>

<p>We know that we have all the graces to achieve this end. “My grace is sufficient for you” (2 Cor. 12:9).</p>

<p>Through the life of St. Josemaría, we also have all the means: our plan of life, our norms, our prayer, our mortification, our examination, our living out of the virtues, our Confession, our attention to little things.</p>

<p>“Today in your prayer,” we’re told in <em>The Forge</em>, “you confirmed your resolution to be a saint. I understand you when you make this more specific by adding, ‘I know I shall succeed, not because I’m sure of myself, Jesus, but because...I’m sure of you’” (<em>ibid</em>., Point 320).</p>

<p>St. Josemaría also liked to tell us that the sanctity that God is asking of us is not an ordinary sanctity, but a canonizable sanctity.</p>

<p>He’s placed the bar very high. Christ has given us so much, a great immeasurable spiritual wealth, in the spirit of Opus Dei.</p>

<p>“But those to whom much has been given, much will be demanded” (Luke 12:48).</p>

<p>We’re told in <em>The Forge,</em> “You are amazed to find there are many different goals that can be pursued within each field in which improvement is possible. —There are other ways within <em>the way</em>, and they help you to avoid possible routine and bring you closer to Our Lord. —Be generous: aim for the highest” (<em>ibid</em>., Point 820).</p>

<p>We see athletes around us going for gold, preparing for the Olympics, breaking records in marathons.</p>

<p>Our Lord wants us to have the same mentality as those athletes, not struggling for a perishable crown. We see people doing all sorts of amazing things to obtain that perishable crown, but we’re striving for “an imperishable crown” (1 Cor. 9:25).</p>

<p>“If you were consistent,” we’re told in <em>The Forge</em>, “now that you’ve seen his light you would want to be as great a saint as you were once a sinner: and you would struggle to make those desires a reality” (<em>ibid</em>., Point 883).</p>

<p>In the <em>Furrow</em>, we’re told, “You present yourself as a wonderful theoretician. But you don’t give way to others even in the most insignificant trifles. I do not believe in that spirit of mortification of yours” (J. Escrivá, <em>Furrow</em>, Point 990).</p>

<p>“Sanctity consists precisely in this: in struggling to be faithful throughout your life and in accepting joyfully the Will of God at the hour of death” (<em>ibid</em>., <em>The Forge</em>, Point 990).</p>

<p>The Church tells us that the Holy Spirit is the great Sanctifier. And so, if we’re striving for holiness, it makes a lot of sense that we would pray to the Holy Spirit frequently.</p>

<p>The sequence of Pentecost Sunday, the <em>Veni Creator Spiritus</em> or the <em>Veni Sancte Spiritus,</em> hymns that we find in many popular Christian devotion booklets, are very good prayers to say in your <em>Thanksgiving after Mass</em> or in other moments of the day, asking the Holy Spirit that we might truly grow along this pathway.</p>

<p>Like good athletes, we keep ourselves very fit and in shape, not allowing any trace of lukewarmness to enter.</p>

<p>We’re told in <em>The Way</em>, “You are lukewarm if you carry out lazily and reluctantly those things that have to do with Our Lord; if deliberately or ‘shrewdly’ you look for some way of cutting down your duties; if you think only of yourself and of your comfort; if your conversations are idle and vain; if you do not abhor venial sin; if you act from human motives” (J. Escrivá, <em>The Way</em>, Point 331).</p>

<p>Many years ago in the 1980s, I was going out to Mass in Manila one Sunday morning and I had to cross one of the main streets of the city and I didn’t know that there was a marathon taking place.</p>

<p>In those days, marathons were just beginning, and I was blocked for about ten minutes while the runners were passing.</p>

<p>But I got a bird’s eye view of all the runners, and it was very interesting to see some people who were running very well, some people not so well, and others looking as though they should have stopped running in marathons about twenty years previously.</p>

<p>But you could roughly divide the runners into those three groups:</p>

<p>Those who entered the race for a bit of a joke, maybe the night before, they did no training. Very soon they got a pain in their side and had to drop out of the race.</p>

<p>Then there were those who had done some training but perhaps hadn’t pushed themselves too much. Eventually, they also developed a pain in their side. But because they’d done some bit of training, they were able to keep going, although with difficulty. Those were the ones with the looks of agony on their faces.</p>

<p>The other group of runners were the ones who had taken the race seriously. They’d done a lot of good training. They went over the course beforehand. They knew where to turn left, where to turn right. They knew where the hills were, where they had to conserve their energy.</p>

<p>And they were running like champions, cruising in the middle of the road. They were going to cruise home and eventually win the race.</p>

<p>You could say that those three types of runners are roughly those that go to hell, go to purgatory, and go to heaven:</p>

<p>Those who go to hell are those who haven’t taken the race seriously, have not heeded any of the calls to vigilance, to training.</p>

<p>Those who go to purgatory have, well, they’ve tried to do something.</p>

<p>And those who go to heaven are those who run like champions and have a little bit in hand so that they can help many other people over the finishing line.</p>

<p>In calling us to be saints, God has called us to be the third type of runner who take the race seriously, to listen to our coach very carefully, to pay attention to all the means that God gives us to triumph in the race, to take every twist and turn of the journey very carefully, to be thinking of other people in the race, and to enjoy the race.</p>

<p>The <em>Entrance Antiphon</em> of today’s Mass says: “Let us rejoice in the Lord and keep festival in honor of all the saints. Let us join with the angels in joyful praise to the Son of God.”</p>

<p>The theme of joy is very prominent: joy for those who have run the race well, who are focused on the goal. They know where they’ve come from, they know where they’re going, they know what the race is all about.</p>

<p>The supernatural last end of the universal redemption is signified in the Mass, the source of our sanctity for all those who practice the Beatitudes as described by Our Lord.</p>

<p>The way we run the race well is to stay close to those sacraments, to love them, to appreciate them, to get as much as we can from them.</p>

<p>The <em>Preface</em> of the Sacred Heart says: “We draw close to the Sacred Heart of Christ to draw water in joy from the wells of salvation” (<em>cf</em>. Isaiah 12:3). Along the pathway of the marathon, we need occasionally to draw plenty of that water.</p>

<p>Our Mother the Church invites us also today to bring to mind in a special way those who have experienced difficulties and temptations similar to our own during life, and yet in the end triumphed over them.</p>

<p>The Church has recognized many saints of every age and condition. Pope John Paul II canonized hundreds of saints, more saints in his pontificate than in the whole of the rest of human history. It’s one of the themes of his pontificate: pointing to that goal of holiness in our lives.</p>

<p>We remember all these saints each year and have recourse to them as intercessors for our various needs. We ask them for things. We know they have great intercessory power before God.</p>

<p>We rejoice and ask the help of this countless multitude who have reached heaven after cheerfully passing through life sowing affection and joy almost without realizing it. They’ve sown the good seed in the lives of so many other people.</p>

<p>They give us inspiration and encouragement of how we have to practice the virtues, and to find that holiness in the ordinary situations of each day.</p>

<p>The Church has liked to remind us that the saints were not superheroes or special people. They would have had to confront difficulties very similar to what we may have to face. They would have had to begin again and again; make a daily effort as we do.</p>

<p>The Church doesn’t mention all of their names. There are too many to mention. But St. John Paul says they were “humble yet great laborers for the growth of the Kingdom of God in history” (<em>cf</em>. John Paul II, Apostolic Exhortation, <em>Christifideles laici</em>, Point 17, December 30, 1988).</p>

<p>It would be a wonderful thing when we get to the end of our life to be able to look back and say, ‘By the grace of God, I’ve managed to sow some seeds. This world is a better place with the fact that I have passed through,’ so that we might inspire other people to take up the baton and run with it.</p>

<p>A struggle against our passions and inordinate tendencies is necessary. We have to make a constant effort to improve.</p>

<p>St. Josemaría said, “Sanctity does not depend on one’s state of life—single, married, widower, or priest—but on our personal correspondence with the grace God grants to each one of us” (J. Escrivá, <em>In Love with the Church</em>, Point 37).</p>

<p>The Church reminds everyone that both the worker who takes up his trade or profession each morning and the mother of a family committed to the daily running of the home should sanctify themselves in all sorts of ways by fulfilling their duties faithfully (<em>cf</em>. John Paul II, Apostolic Exhortation, <em>Christifideles laici</em>, Point 15, December 30, 1988).</p>

<p>It can be consoling for us also to realize that people with whom we had dealings a short time ago are now contemplating the face of God. We continue to be united to them by profound friendship and affection through the Communion of Saints.</p>

<p>St. Teresa of Ávila had a prayer to the Blessed in heaven where she said, “O holy ones who knew how to prepare so delightful an inheritance, help us now that you are so near the fount of all holiness. Draw water for those of us who are perishing from thirst” (St. Teresa, <em>The Exclamations of the Soul to God</em>).</p>

<p>In the <em>Preface</em> of today’s Mass we say: “Father, today we keep the festival of your holy city, the heavenly Jerusalem. Our brothers and sisters, the saints, now sing your praises forever around your throne and their glory fills us with joy. Our communion with them through your Church gives us inspiration and strength as we hasten on our pilgrimage of faith, eager to meet them.”</p>

<p>We, the faithful on earth, are the pilgrim Church on our way to heaven. While we make progress towards heaven, we need to gather up the treasure of good works we will one day present before God.</p>

<p>Today’s feast day reminds us to make good use of our time, and so that advice of the Gospel that says, “Store up for yourselves treasures in heaven” (Matt. 6:20).</p>

<p>We hear a lot of people wondering about their investments, their return, and their interest. With the same focus and zeal, we could be interested in our interest that we’re accruing in heaven and the good things that we do.</p>

<p>We hear the Lord’s invitation clearly: “If anyone will come after me, let him take up his cross and follow me” (Matt. 16:24).</p>

<p>We know that we are called to the fullness of Christian life through our professional occupation. Work is the hinge of our sanctity. God wants us to encounter Him in our work by carrying it out with human perfection and supernatural outlook.</p>

<p>It’s there in the middle of the world that we long for the presence of the Lord, whom we will one day see face to face.</p>

<p>And so, we offer up all our activities, practice charity in our dealings with others, and are generous in bringing that work that has been entrusted to us to completion. By talking with Our Father God as a friend, we can continually refine our contemplative spirit in the midst of the ordinary activities of every day.</p>

<p>“For the vast majority of men,” said St. Josemaría, “to be a saint implies sanctifying their work, sanctifying themselves in it, and sanctifying others through it. Thus they encounter God in the course of their daily lives” (J. Escrivá, <em>Conversations</em>, Point 55).</p>

<p>What else did the vast host of glorified souls do? Mothers, intellectuals, manual workers—what did they do to win heaven? They just did the ordinary things; they fulfilled their work well.</p>

<p>This is of absolute importance since we are desiring to abide with God forever in heaven. If we persevere in union with Christ and make an effort to sanctify the small realities of every day that Our Lord looks upon with affection, that crown will truly be ours.</p>

<p>If at any given moment our fidelity might be lacking, we can rectify accordingly and set out once again on that path. That’s our pathway on earth; sometimes falling down, like Our Lord on the way to Calvary, but always getting up again.</p>

<p>Winning heaven is the challenge we face with the grace of God each day.</p>

<p>The Blessed in heaven are not those who never fell in this life, but they’re those who got up again. Possibly they got up again many times.</p>

<p>Happily, that goal of holiness involves the task in hand and often is effected precisely among the persons that God has wanted to place at our side.</p>

<p>God has said, “Love your neighbor” (Matt. 22:39). He didn’t say, ‘Love your friends.’ We choose our friends, but God chooses our neighbor. And He invites us to love that neighbor.</p>

<p>We need to realize fully that our generous and holy resolve to improve constantly has an important impact on others. We need to give a lot of good example, and to keep trying to be more Christ-like, to practice more virtues.</p>

<p>If through God’s grace and the help of others we do reach heaven, we won’t enter eternal glory alone, but we have to try and draw many others in with us.</p>

<p>Many of those who now contemplate the face of God in heaven perhaps did not have an opportunity during their time on earth to carry out great deeds. However, they did fulfill their modest daily duties as best they could.</p>

<p>On occasion, they may have made mistakes. They gave in to impatience, or laziness, or pride, or perhaps even sinned gravely.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, they repented right away and took advantage of the sacrament of Confession to begin again—the importance of the apostolate of Confession, of sharing with other people our magnificent experience of the sacrament of joy.</p>

<p>The Blessed in heaven had big hearts and led fruitful lives since they knew how to sacrifice themselves for Christ.</p>

<p>We too are very much in need of Our Lord’s great mercy during our journey to heaven. Our Lord keeps us going day by day and doesn’t let us falter.</p>

<p>It’s a tremendous good for us to pause frequently to consider Him and the graces we have received, to cast a contemplative gaze back over our week, our month, our year.</p>

<p>A yearly retreat is a really good way to keep on the right path as the years pass by, possibly more important at certain stages of our life than others. But it keeps us on track, reminds us of the important things, helps us not to get lost in the race.</p>

<p>The Blessed in their lives never consider themselves saints. On the contrary, they are often convinced of their great need for divine mercy.</p>

<p>To a greater or lesser degree, everyone experiences sickness, or tribulation, or low energy periods in which everything entails a particular effort. Failure may come our way, but we have some successes also.</p>

<p>Perhaps at times the saints were moved to tears, but they knew and put into practice those words that Our Lord says in Scripture: “Come to me, all you who labor and are heavy burdened and I will give you rest” (Matt. 11:28).</p>

<p>They found their rest in Christ. The Blessed always lean on Christ for support. They visit Him in the tabernacle to draw renewed energy from His presence there.</p>

<p>The personalities of the Blessed vary enormously, but in this life they had one distinguishing feature in common: they lived charitably with those around them.</p>

<p>Our Lord had said: “In this will everyone know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another” (John 13:35). This is the common denominator of the saints who currently enjoy the vision of God.</p>

<p>Our Lady awaits us in heaven also. She’ll offer us a hand to take us into the presence of her Son and of our faithful departed loved ones who even now watch over us.</p>

<p>Mary, Queen of all the saints, pray for us.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

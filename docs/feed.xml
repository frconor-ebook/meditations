Conor Donnelly</p>

<p>(<em>Proofread</em>)</p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>We’re told in St. Mark that Jesus “was silent and made no answer” (Mark 14:61). For thirty years, Jesus had lived a life of silence. Mary and Joseph were the only ones who knew the mystery of the Son of God.</p>

<p>During His public life, when He returned to His hometown, His relatives were disconcerted by His wisdom and His miracles. They had known Him only from His exemplary life of work.</p>

<p>During the three years of His public life, we see how He withdraws into the silence of prayer, to be alone with His Father God. He withdraws from the superficial clamor of the multitude that wants to make Him their king. He performs miracles without ostentation, asking people He cures to refrain from publicizing His powers.</p>

<p>We see that one of the characteristics of the life of Christ was silence. His silence before His enemies in the Passion is very moving: “He was silent and made no answer,” we’re told (Mark 14:61). In the face of so many false accusations, He makes no defense.</p>

<p>St. Jerome comments, “Our God and Savior, who because of his mercy had redeemed the world, allows himself to be led to his death like a lamb, without a word of complaint or self-defense. The silence of Jesus obtains pardon for the protest and excuse of Adam” (Jerome, <em>Commentary on St. Mark’s Gospel</em>).</p>

<p>Jesus says nothing during the hearings before Herod and Pilate. We see Him standing silent at their preference for Barabbas in front of His hate-filled enemies.</p>

<p>We’re told in St. Matthew: “When he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he made no answer. Then Pilate said to him, ‘Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?’ But he gave him no answer, not even to a single charge, so that the governor wondered greatly” (Matt. 27:12-14).</p>

<p>The silence of Jesus in the face of human passions, before the sins which are committed every day by humanity, is not a silence of anger. It is a silence that’s full of patience and love.</p>

<p>The silence of Calvary is that of a God who comes to redeem all men by His indescribable agony of the Cross. The silence of Jesus in the tabernacle is that of a love which waits for a response. It’s the patient silence of one who treasures our attentions.</p>

<p>Christ’s silence during His earthly life represents interior strength and sense of purpose. One writer says, “Those who complain continually about their misfortunes or their bad luck should look at the example of Our Lord. Those who proclaim their problems to the four winds should consider the behavior of Christ. Those who feel compelled to explain and excuse their actions, who wait anxiously for praise or approval, should take note of Christ, who says nothing.</p>

<p>“We will imitate him when we learn to accept life’s duties and worries without sterile complaints, when we confront our personal problems without dumping them in someone else’s lap, when we face squarely the consequences of our actions, when we do our work for the glory of God without looking for earthly praise” (F. Suarez, <em>The Two Faces of Silence, Nuestro Tiempo</em>).</p>

<p>“Jesus says nothing,” we’re told in Scripture. We have to learn to say nothing on many occasions. At times vanity will have us say things which should have been kept locked in the soul.</p>

<p>The silent figure of Christ is the ever-present model to reproach empty or useless words. His example will lead us to remain silent before calumny and rumor. The Prophet Isaiah says, “In silence and in hope will be your fortitude and your courage” (Isa. 30:15). He encourages us that our fortitude is grounded in silence and in hope.</p>

<p>At the same time, Our Lord doesn’t always remain silent. He teaches us that sometimes we have to speak out when it’s necessary, with charity and with fortitude, avoiding the silence of consent.</p>

<p>There is a silence that can collaborate with lying, a silence that can cooperate with cowardice, a silence which springs from the love of comfort and the fear of complicating one’s life. You can close your eyes to what is disagreeable. You can put off making a fraternal correction that ought to be made at home or at work.</p>

<p>The word of Jesus is full of authority as He faces injustice and abuse. In St. Matthew we’re told, “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour widows’ houses and for a pretense you make long prayers” (Matt. 23:14).</p>

<p>St. John the Baptist was “the voice of one crying in the wilderness” (Matt. 3:3). He teaches us to say everything that must be said, even though it may seem as if we too are crying in the wilderness.</p>

<p>Our Lord will not allow our words to be wasted. It’s important that we say what has to be said, without worrying ourselves about the immediate consequences.</p>

<p>If each Christian were to speak in conformity with the faith, we would surely change the world. We can’t sit by silently in the face of such crimes of abortion and the degradation of marriage and the family. Nor can we surrender to those forces that would seek to remove God from the formation of the young.</p>

<p>We can’t be silent at attacks upon the Pope and Our Lady, or upon institutions of the Church. To be silent when we should be speaking out can be a way of collaborating with evil, because others might think that our silence means consent.</p>

<p>If Catholics were to speak out where there is need, if they were to boycott anti-Catholic publications or literature, it would be more difficult for those enterprises to prosper.</p>

<p>In our prayer today, we can ask Our Lord for the grace to speak out when necessary. At times, those occasions will be when we’re with a little group of our friends, coming or going to school or to work. In letters to the editor, we can write in praise of a good article or to criticize a bad one.</p>

<p>We should always act with charity. It’s worthwhile to remember that true charity always goes hand in hand with fortitude. We need to exercise good manners, always working with the intention of bringing souls to Jesus Christ. Yet we should act at the same time with the fortitude of Our Lord.</p>

<p>If upon realizing that his life was in danger, St. John the Baptist had remained silent or retired to the sidelines of public affairs, he would not have been beheaded by Herod. But John was not that kind of man. He was not “a reed shaken by the wind” (Matt. 11:7). He was true to his vocation and also to his principles to the end.</p>

<p>If he had remained silent, he could have lived a few more years, but his disciples would not have been the first to follow Our Lord. He would not have “prepared and made straight the way of the Lord,” as we’re told by Isaiah (Isa. 40:3). He would not have lived up to his vocation. His life would have been bereft of meaning.</p>

<p>Probably Our Lord is not asking us to suffer a martyr’s death, but He is asking for courage and fortitude in facing up to the demands of ordinary life. Perhaps He is asking us to stop watching a bad TV show or to cease putting off an apostolic conversation.</p>

<p>We can’t allow ourselves to hide behind excuses when there is a lot of apostolic work to be done. We have to act with optimism, loving the world and the good that is in it, while seeking to increase that goodness. We can do this with the example of a joyful family and of the youthful love that is born of holy purity.</p>

<p>There are other kinds of cowardly silence which we have to struggle against: the silence we might maintain with the person next to us. But God has put that person there so that we might be a beacon of light for him or for her.</p>

<p>It’s hard to imagine that we can be courageous at all in this life if we are not courageous first with ourselves, especially when we’re talking with our spiritual director, to say the things that need to be said.</p>

<p>Many of our friends, on seeing that we truly practice what we preach, will be attracted to the faith. Centuries ago, many people converted after witnessing the martyrdom of the first Christians.</p>

<p>We can learn a lot from Our Lord’s silence. We’re told in the Psalms, “My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When shall I come and behold the face of God?” (Ps. 42:2). God lives in our midst and often in a very silent way.</p>

<p>Throughout the Old Testament, God makes known His intention of having an ongoing presence among men. The “tent of meeting” was the first temple to God in the desert. Upon the tent there came to rest a cloud which symbolized the glory of God and His presence.</p>

<p>“Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle” (Ex. 40:34). The cloud was a sign of the divine presence (<em>cf</em>. Num. 12:5; 1 Kings 8:10-11).</p>

<p>Much later, the Temple of Jerusalem was the place where the Israelites worshiped God (<em>cf</em>. Ex. 23:15-17). It was the place they had been longing for while they were in the desert.</p>

<p>They would recall the enthusiasm of old when they would go to the house of the Lord, singing songs of joy and praise: “How lovely is your dwelling place, O Lord of hosts! My soul longs, yes, faints for the courts of the Lord; my heart and flesh sing for joy to the living God” (Ps. 84:1-2).</p>

<p>To be far from the sanctuary was to be deprived of true happiness. “My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When shall I come and behold the face of God?” (Ps. 42:2).</p>

<p>In the fullness of time, the Word became flesh. In the moment of the Incarnation the power of the Most High overshadowed Our Lady (<em>cf</em>. Luke 1:35). This is an expression of the omnipotence of God.</p>

<p>Following upon the Incarnation, Our Lady, the Virgin, became the Tabernacle of God. “The Word of God dwelt among us,” we’re told in St. John (John 1:14).</p>

<p>St. John uses a Greek verb for “dwelt” which originally meant “to pitch one’s tent,” hence, to live in a place. “The careful reader of Scripture will immediately think of the tabernacle, or tent, in the period of the exodus from Egypt, where God showed his presence before all the people of Israel through certain signs of his glory, such as the cloud covering the tent.</p>

<p>“In many passages of the Old Testament it is announced that God ‘will dwell in the midst of the people’ (<em>cf</em>. Jer. 7:3; Ezek. 43:9; Sir. 24:8). These signs of God’s presence, first in the pilgrim Tent of the Ark in the desert and then in the Temple of Jerusalem, are followed by the most wonderful form of God’s presence among us—Jesus Christ, perfect God and perfect Man, in whom the ancient promise is fulfilled in a way that far exceeded men’s greatest expectations. Also the promise made through Isaiah about the ‘Emmanuel’ or ‘God with us’ (Isa. 7:14; <em>cf</em>. Matt. 1:23) is completely fulfilled through this dwelling of the Incarnate Son of God among us” (<em>The Navarre Bible</em>, St. John).</p>

<p>From that time onwards, we can say with exactitude that God lives among us. We can be next to Him every day, closer to Him than anyone might imagine possible—God truly dwelling among us.</p>

<p>From the moment of the Incarnation we can affirm that God is with us in the personal presence of Jesus Christ. As both true God and true Man, Jesus is closer to us than any other being. Jesus is “God with us.”</p>

<p>In earlier times, the Israelites would say that God was “with them.” Now we can say this in a very literal sense.</p>

<p>When Christ traveled about Palestine, He made an effort to preach in many towns. “When Jesus had finished these parables,” we’re told, “he went away from there” (Matt. 13:53). God left one town to go and meet other people.</p>

<p>When the priest consecrates the host during the Mass, he brings Christ to the altar with His Holy Humanity. He is there in the Eucharist with a special presence for as long as the sacramental species last.</p>

<p>This presence affects the Body of Christ in a direct way and the Three Persons of the Holy Trinity in an indirect way. The Word is tied to Christ’s humanity, while the Father and the Holy Spirit are related by the mutual immanence of their divine Persons (<em>cf</em>. Council of Trent, Decree, <em>De Sanctissima Eucharistia</em>).</p>

<p>Christ is really present in the Tabernacle with His Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity. It can be said quite literally that ‘God is here, close to me.’ We could make that act of faith: “My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me, that you hear me.”</p>

<p>Down through the centuries the Church has developed a precise way of describing the Eucharistic presence, often requiring such exact definition to counter erroneous beliefs.</p>

<p>The Eucharistic presence is a <em>real</em> presence, a silent presence. It is not symbolic, nor does it signify or insinuate any image.</p>

<p>It is not fictitious, or merely the product of the imagination or the will. It is <em>substantial</em> because the words of the Consecration spoken by the priest change the substance of bread and the wine into the substance of the Body and Blood of Christ.</p>

<p>Paul VI says, “Every theological explanation which seeks some understanding of this mystery must, in order to be in accord with Catholic faith, maintain that in the reality itself, independently of our mind, the bread and wine have ceased to exist after the Consecration, so that it is the adorable Body and Blood of Our Lord Jesus that from then on are really before us under the sacramental species of bread and wine…” (Paul VI, Apostolic Letter, <em>Credo of the People of God</em>, Point 25, June 30, 1968).</p>

<p>In the encyclical <em>Mysterium Fidei</em>, Paul VI says, “As a result of transubstantiation, the species of bread and wine…contain a new ‘reality’ which we may justly term ‘ontological.’ Not that there lies under those species what was already there before, but something quite different; and that not only because of the faith of the Church, but in objective reality… (<em>cf</em>. Paul VI, Encyclical, <em>Mysterium Fidei,</em> Point 46, September 3, 1965).</p>

<p>Jesus is silently present in our Tabernacles whether or not we take advantage of this amazing wonder. He is there silently, with His Body and His Blood, His Soul and His Divinity. God made Man. He could not be closer.</p>

<p>The Church possesses the Author of all grace and the cause of our sanctification. We may venture to say that the Eucharistic presence of Christ is the sacramental prolongation of the Incarnation.</p>

<p>From the Tabernacle Jesus invites us to bring to Him our concerns and our petitions. In the <em>visit to the Blessed Sacrament</em> and other acts of worship offered to the Holy Eucharist, we give thanks for this great gift.</p>

<p>There we can go to find new strength, to tell Jesus that we miss Him, to tell Him that we need Him very much. “The Eucharist is reserved in the churches and oratories [to serve as] the spiritual center of a religious community or of a parish, and [indeed] of the universal Church and of all humanity, since beneath the appearance of the species, Christ is contained: the invisible Head of the Church, the Redeemer of the world, the center of all hearts, ‘by whom,’ says St. Paul, ‘all things are and by whom we exist’ (1 Cor. 8:6)” (<em>ibid</em>., Point 68).</p>

<p>It has been the constant practice of the Church to adore Christ’s silent presence in the Tabernacle. If we recall how much reverence the Israelites had for their “tent of meeting” in the desert and for the Temple at Jerusalem, which were figures or images of reality, how much more reverence should we have for Christ truly present in the Tabernacle?</p>

<p>In the first centuries of the Church, the main reason for reserving the Sacred Species was for the sake of those who were not able to get to Mass, especially the sick and the dying, and also for those in prison due to religious persecution. The Sacrament of the Lord was brought with piety and fervor so that these Christians might also receive Communion.</p>

<p>Later, faith in the real presence of Christ led to the cult of the Blessed Sacrament, and the Church authoritatively approved those practices. The Council of Trent declared, “There is, therefore, no room left for doubt that all the faithful of Christ in accordance with a custom always received in the Catholic Church offer in veneration the worship of <em>latria</em> which is due to the true God, to this most Holy Sacrament” (Council of Trent, <em>Session XIII</em>).</p>

<p>In the thirteenth century, St. Thomas Aquinas composed a Eucharistic hymn which embodies the faith of the Church in a faithful and pious manner. We should make this hymn our own so as to nourish our piety and give honor to the Blessed Sacrament.</p>

<p>The hymn states: “O Godhead hid, devoutly I adore you, Who truly are within the forms before me; To you my heart I bow with bended knee, As failing quite in contemplating thee” (Prayer in Adoration Before the Blessed Sacrament, <em>Adore te Devote</em>).</p>

<p>Here we have all the truths of the faith. We have understanding with humility and thanksgiving, amazement before the power of God, surprise at the extent of His mercy. With the confidence gained by having Him so close by, we can ask Our Lord for His grace to unite ourselves to His most holy will.</p>

<p>Next to the silent Tabernacle, we can learn how to love. There we will draw the strength necessary to remain faithful. We’ll find consolation in times of sorrow.</p>

<p>He silently waits for us and He rejoices when we are next to Him, even if only for a short while. There Jesus waits for His people who suffer the contradictions of this life. He comforts them with the warmth of His understanding and His love.</p>

<p>It is in the Tabernacle that the words of Our Lord come to life, specifically those words where He says, “Come to me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest” (Matt. 11:28).</p>

<p>We should not fail to visit Him. He is waiting for us. He has many gifts prepared for us.</p>

<p>Mary, we turn to you, Comfort of the afflicted, Cause of our joy. We ask you for the grace to learn from the silence of Our Lord in His public life, and also in the Tabernacle.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

Conor Donnelly</p>

<p><em>(Proofread)</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here. That you see me, that you hear me.</em></p>

<p><em>I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins, and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful.</em></p>

<p><em>My immaculate mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>John Fisher was ordained a priest in 1491. He held several teaching posts at the University of Cambridge, and at the same time was responsible for the spiritual direction of Queen Margaret, the mother of Henry VIII. He later occupied the chair of theology which the queen had endowed at Cambridge.</p>

<p>Early in 1504, he was named Vice Chancellor of Cambridge University, and at the end of the year was consecrated Bishop of Rochester, the smallest and poorest diocese in England.</p>

<p>Two days later, he was appointed to office as a member of the King’s Council. Thomas More studied literature and philosophy at Oxford and law at the New Inn. In 1504, he was elected a member of parliament and held several public offices. He earned great prestige because of his knowledge of the law and his integrity.</p>

<p>Although his professional life was intensely time-consuming, he always found time for his family, which was his most important concern, and for his literary and historical studies. He published various books and essays. In 1529, he was appointed Lord Chancellor of England, in spite of having made it clear to the King that he would not agree to the dissolution of the King’s marriage.</p>

<p>Taking a full interest in the problems of his day, he dedicated himself to his work with the desire of implementing the laws and institutions of his times with a Christian approach. Both men were beheaded in 1535 for refusing to recognize the supremacy of Henry VIII over the Church in England and the annulment of the King’s marriage.</p>

<p>In England in 1534, all citizens who had come of age were ordered to take the oath unto the Act of Succession, which acknowledged the union of Henry VIII with Anne Boleyn as a marriage. The King proclaimed himself supreme head of the Church in England and denied any authority to the Pope. John Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, and Thomas More, Chancellor of the Realm, both refused to take the oath. They were imprisoned in 1534 and were beheaded the following year.</p>

<p>At a time when many acceded to the royal will, it would scarcely have been noticed if these two had taken the oath. They would have saved their lives, their property, their positions, as so many others did. Both of these men, however, were true to the faith, even to the point of martyrdom.</p>

<p>They were able to give their lives when the time came, because they were of the kind who lived their vocation day by day, giving daily witness to the faith, sometimes in matters that might have seemed of little or no consequence.</p>

<p>Thomas More is a man very close to ourselves because he was an ordinary Christian who knew how to combine, in perfect unity of life, his vocation as the father of a family, with his profession as a lawyer, and later as Lord Chancellor of England. He was at home in the world. He loved all the human realities that formed the framework of his life in the place and position where God wanted him to be.</p>

<p>At the same time, he lived such detachment from earthly things and had such love for the Cross that we can say he drew all of his strength from it. He was in the habit of meditating on a passage of the passion of Our Lord every Friday. When his children or his wife complained about ordinary difficulties and annoyances, he told them they could not expect to go to heaven on feather beds.</p>

<p>He reminded them of the sufferings Our Lord had undergone and that the servant is not greater than his master. As well as using the ordinary little pin pricks and routine mishaps of the day as a means of identifying himself with the Cross, More offered up other penances.</p>

<p>Some days he wore a hair shirt, a garment of rough cloth next to his skin. One writer says he continued this practice during his imprisonment in the Tower of London, in spite of the cold, the damp, and all the privations he had to put up with during those long months. It was here in the Cross that he found his strength.</p>

<p>We are Christians who follow Christ closely in the midst of the world and bear witness to Him, generally silently. We can ask ourselves also, do we find strength in being detached from earthly things and through the daily practice of mortification, penance, and prayer.</p>

<p>When Thomas More had to resign his post as Lord Chancellor, he gathered his family together to talk to them about the future that awaited them and how they would manage financially. He summarized his whole career, saying, “I have been brought up at Oxford, at the Inn of Chancery, at Lincoln’s Inn, and also at the King’s Court. From the lowest to the highest. Yet I now have little above one hundred pounds a year. If we are to continue together, all must become contributors. But my counsel is that it shall not be best for us to fall to the lowest fare first.”</p>

<p>Then he suggested to them a gradual descent, reminding them how it is possible to be content at every level. One writer says, if they were unable to support themselves at even the lowest level, that one at which he had managed to live while in Oxford, he said with peace and good humor, “Then we may yet with bags and wallets go a-begging together, and hoping for, for pity, some good folks will give us of their charity, and so still keep company and be merry together.” He never allowed anything to disturb the unity and peace of his family, even when he was away or in prison.</p>

<p>He lived detached from things when he had them, and with great joy when he did not possess or even have access to even the most indispensable necessities of life. He was always able to rise above circumstances. He knew how to celebrate important events even behind prison bars. A contemporary biographer tells us that while he was imprisoned in the Tower, he would dress more elegantly on important feast days, so far as his meager wardrobe would permit. He always remained cheerful and good-humored, even at the moment when he was ascending the scaffold, because he relied firmly on prayer.</p>

<p>“Good Lord, the things that I pray for,” he said, “give me your grace to labor for.” He did not expect God to give him those things that, with just a little effort on his part, he could obtain for himself. He worked all his life so as to become a lawyer of great prestige before being appointed Lord Chancellor. He never forgot, however, the need for prayer. Even though at times, and particularly in circumstances as dramatic as those leading up to his execution, it was not easy for him.</p>

<p>During those days, he wrote a long prayer in which many of the pious and moving considerations made by a man who knew he was about to die. He exclaimed, “Grant me, my Lord, a desire to be with you, not so as to avoid the calamities of this world, nor even to avoid the pains of purgatory, nor those of hell, nor to gain the joys of heaven, not out of consideration for my own profit, but simply through true love for you.”</p>

<p>St. Thomas More is always presented to us as a man of prayer. St. Josemaría says in <em>The Furrow</em>, “This enabled him to be faithful whatever the circumstances, to his commitments as a citizen and as a Christian. Thereby living a perfect unity of life. This is how we too have to be. A Catholic without prayer is the same as a soldier without arms.” We could ask ourselves, well how is my relationship with Christ?</p>

<p>Do I try to grow each day in intimacy with Him? Does my prayer influence the rest of my day? He prayed, “Give me the grace, Good Lord, to set the world at naught. To have my mind well united to you. To not depend on the changing opinions of others. So that I may think joyfully of God, and tenderly implore your help. So that I may lean on God’s strength and make an effort to love Him. So as to thank Him ceaselessly for His benefits. So as to redeem the time I have wasted.”</p>

<p>The saint wrote these words in the margin of the Book of Hours he had with him in the Tower of London. They were days in which he gave himself over completely to contemplating the Passion, and in this way to preparing himself for his own death in union with the death Christ suffered on the cross.</p>

<p>Saint Thomas’s last moments on earth were seen not only by God. His love for God had been clear to everyone around him, day by day in his family life, in his simple, pleasant manner, in the way he carried out his profession as a lawyer, in holding the highest post in the land, that of Lord Chancellor.</p>

<p>It was through fulfilling the duties of each day, some of which were important, others less important, that he sanctified himself and helped others to find God. Among many other examples of his effective apostolate, he has left us that of the apostolate he did with his son-in-law, who had fallen into the Lutheran heresy.</p>

<p>He said to his daughter, “I have borne a long time with your husband. I have reasoned and argued with him on these points of religion, and given to him my poor fatherly counsel, but I perceive none of this is able to call him home, and therefore, Meg, I will no longer dispute with him, but will give him over, and get me to God to pray for him.”</p>

<p>More’s words and prayers were effective, as soon afterwards, Roper returned to the fullness of the faith and afterwards suffered much through remaining loyal to the Catholic faith. Saint Thomas More remains among us as a living example for our conduct as Christians. He is the fruitful seed of peace and joy.</p>

<p>As was his passage on earth, at home among his family and friends, in the law courts, in the university chair, at court, in the embassies, in parliament, and in government. He is also a silent patron of England who shed his blood in defense of the unity of the Church and of the spiritual power of the Vicar of Christ.</p>

<p>One writer says, “As the blood of Christians is a germinating seed, the blood of Thomas More slowly seeps into and soaks the souls of those who approach him, drawn by his prestige, his sweetness of character, and his strength. More will be the silent apostle of the return to the faith of a whole nation.”</p>

<p>We can ask John Fisher and Thomas More to teach us to imitate them in their Christian coherence, so that we may live as God wants us to in all things, both great and small, whatever the circumstances of our lives. The opening prayer of today’s Mass says, “In the death of your martyrs, O God, we see the noblest of testimonies to the true faith. Grant we pray that strengthened by the prayers of Saint Thomas More and Saint John Fisher, we may bear witness in our lives to the faith we confess with our lips.”</p>

<p>When we contemplate the lives of these great saints, also of the English-speaking world, we could note the first necessary step in persevering to the end of the way: that desire of wanting to be a saint. We could ask them for those real and effective desires. The psalms we read, “My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. As a deer longs for flowing streams, so longs my soul for you, O God. When shall I come and behold the face of God?” (Ps. 42:2–3).</p>

<p>The deer attempting to quench its thirst with water is the psalmist’s symbolic way of describing the desire for God present in the heart of an upright person. A thirst and vehement desire for God. Such is the aspiration of one who is not content to accept worldly success as the satisfaction for human ambitions. We’re told in Saint Matthew’s Gospel, “What will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his life?” (Matt. 16:26).</p>

<p>Our Lord’s question forces us to take a radical look at the broad horizon of our life to which only God gives ultimate meaning. “My soul thirsts for God.” Saint Josemaría says, “The saints are not abnormally gifted people, nor have they necessarily been completely perfect since childhood. They are men and women with a great desire to belong to God completely, despite their defects.” We could each ask ourselves, “Have I a true desire to be a saint?”</p>

<p>The answer most assuredly would be in the affirmative, yes. But our reply should not be as to a theoretical question, he says, “Because for some, holiness is unattainable, something to do with ascetical theology, but not a real goal, a living reality.”</p>

<p>“We want to make it happen with the help of God’s grace. So longs my soul for you, O God.” We have to start by making the desire for holiness flourish in our own soul, telling Our Lord, “I want to be a saint, or at least when I experience my softness and weakness, I want to want to be a saint.”</p>

<p>To banish doubt and make holiness more than an empty word, we need to turn and look at Christ. The Second Vatican Council says, “The Lord Jesus, the divine teacher and model of all perfection, preached holiness of life, of which he is the author and maker, to each and every one of his disciples without distinction” (Lumen Gentium, 40).</p>

<p>“You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect” (Matt. 5:48). He has taken the initiative. If He had not, the possibility of being a saint would never have occurred to us. Jesus put it to us as a command, “Be perfect.” It is not surprising that the Church makes sure her children hear these resounding words.</p>

<p>Therefore, all the faithful, says the Second Vatican Council, are invited and obliged to holiness and the perfection of their own state of life. Think then how deep our desire for holiness has to be. In Scripture, the prophet Daniel is “a man of desires” (Dan. 9:23).</p>

<p>It would be wonderful if we were all worthy of such a title. The first thing that souls must do if they embark on the path of holiness, says St. Teresa, is really to want to be saints, whatever may come, whatever may happen to them, however hard they may have to labor, whoever may complain of them, whether they reach their goal or die on the road.</p>

<p>In <em>The Furrow</em>, we’re told, “Allow your soul to be consumed by desires, desires for loving, for forgetting yourself, for sanctity, for heaven. Do not stop to wonder whether the time will come for seeing them accomplished, as some pseudo-advisor might suggest. Make them more fervent each day, for the Holy Spirit says that He is pleased with men of desires.”</p>

<p>“Let your desires be operative and put them into practice in your daily tasks.” We should examine our conscience to see if our desires for holiness are sincere and effective, and furthermore to see if we take them as something obligatory for a faithful Christian, as the Second Vatican Council states, in response to God’s desires.</p>

<p>This response could reveal the reason for so much apathy and weakness in our interior struggle. In <em>The Way</em>, we’re told, “You tell me yes, you want to. Very good, but do you want to as a miser longs for gold, as a mother loves her child, as a worldling craves for honors, or as a wretched sensualist seeks his pleasure?”</p>

<p>“No, then you don’t really want to.” We could try to develop these desires with the virtue of hope. One can only effectively desire something when there is a hope of attaining it. If we consider some aim to be impossible and not for us, we will not really desire it. Our theological hope rests on God.</p>

<p>Softness and lukewarmness can destroy our desires for holiness. There is need for vigilance. The conversion of Cornelius the Centurion, mentioned in today’s Mass, in the first reading, shows that God is no respecter of persons. Saint Peter explains to the others what has happened. The Holy Spirit, we’re told in the Acts, “fell upon them just as on us at the beginning” (Acts 11:15).</p>

<p>There are no limits or barriers to the power of the Holy Spirit. This is true in our case, just as it was for Cornelius, who was not a Jew by race or nation. On the one hand, we have to want to be saints, but we must also take into account that we’re told in the Psalms that, “Unless the Lord builds the house, those who build it labor in vain” (Ps. 127:1).</p>

<p>Humility leads us to count always above all on God’s grace. To this we add our efforts to acquire virtues and practice them continuously, and our apostolic zeal, since our concept of personal holiness should not be one which ignores others or which is indifferent to charity. That would be contradictory.</p>

<p>There is our desire to be with Christ on the Cross. That is, to be mortified, not rejecting sacrifice in small things, and if need be in big things. We should be forewarned about approaching God with reservations and without renunciation, trying to make the love of God compatible with what is not pleasing to Him.</p>

<p>We should be alert in developing our desires for holiness continually through prayer, by asking God for the ability to struggle each day, to discover in our examination of conscience the places where our love is growing cold. Saint John of the Cross says, “Desire for holiness is real when we fulfill acts of piety with refinement, not omitting them or delaying them for any reason whatever, refusing to be led by our moods and feelings.”</p>

<p>Because the soul truly in love with God never fails through laziness to do all in its power to seek God’s Son the Beloved. And having done all it could, is still not satisfied as it thinks it has done nothing. The virtue of humility enables us to avoid a sense of self-satisfaction with what we have done, and not to be content with ineffectual desires.</p>

<p>It lets us see how we can do more to show the sincerity of our desires with deeds of love, ensuring that our sins, offenses, and negligences don’t frustrate our expectations. Humility doesn’t clip the wings of our desires, but rather helps us to understand the need to have recourse to God to make them come true. With God’s grace, we can do all in our power to make virtue grow in our soul by removing obstacles, fleeing from occasions of sin, and bravely resisting temptations. We should avoid discouragement in the struggle to improve.</p>

<p>We have to count on time and on God’s grace. “My soul thirsts for God, for the living God” (Ps. 42:2). St. Josemaría says, “Is this thirst compatible with our experience of our defects and even our falls? Yes, because saints are not those who have never sinned, but those who have always got up again.” Refusal to pursue holiness and seeing ourselves full of defects is a hidden form of pride and obvious cowardice which will end up stifling our desires for God. “Feeling easily deflated,” says St. Josemaría, “and lying down under adversity is characteristic of cowardly souls lacking the firm virtue of trusting in God’s promises.”</p>

<p>Abandoning God, ceasing to struggle because of our defects when there is opposition is a serious mistake. A very subtle and dangerous temptation, which can lead us to that form of pride called pusillanimity, lack of courage and strength to bear misfortune or undertake large enterprises. We may need to rid ourselves of false illusions in wanting to be saints in a day. That would be impossible, unless God decided to perform a miracle, which He has no reason to do, since He gives us all the graces we need by ordinary means in a continuous and progressive way.</p>

<p>One writer says, “An effective desire for holiness consists in a conscious and determined effort to use the necessary means to attain holiness.” If desire is lacking, nothing can be done. One doesn’t even try. Desires alone are not enough. We must be patient then, and not try to banish in a day the many habits we have picked up in neglecting our spiritual health. “As the deer longs for flowing streams, so my soul longs for you, O God” (Ps. 42:1). We could almost hear those words on the lips and heart of St. Thomas More and Bishop John Fisher.</p>

<p>Let us try to keep our desire for God alive, to enkindle the flame of faith and hope in the fire of the love of God, enlivening our virtues and burning away our miseries. We will quench our thirst for holiness with the water that springs up to eternal life. And always our mother will be there to help us.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice.

Conor Donnelly</p>

<p>(<em>Proofread</em>)</p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>“Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the desert, to be tempted by the devil. And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, afterwards he was hungry. And the tempter coming said to him: ‘If you be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.’ He answered and said: ‘It is written: not in bread alone does man live, but in every word that proceeds from the mouth of God’” (Matt. 4:1-4).</p>

<p>We find the devil mentioned very strongly in this particular moment of the Gospel.</p>

<p>Some people tend to laugh at the very suggestion of the existence of the devil, but his presence in Scripture and in the <em>Catechism of the Catholic Church</em> is very clear. Often, it’s his most powerful weapon that people ignore him, and so he acts like a thief. But he exists and he tempted Christ.</p>

<p>He is the enemy of our redemption. He tempted and made our first parents sin. He disobeyed God and is eager to get man to do the same. He’s envious of the relationship between man and God and seeks to destroy it. Our Lord talks a lot about him, and so we can’t ignore him.</p>

<p>We have a lot of faith in God. It’s good also that we have faith in the devil. But the fact that he tempts us and bothers us on a daily basis doesn’t mean that we need to lose our peace, because we count on the help of Our Father God.</p>

<p>We can always be positive in our fight. We need not look on temptation as a burden. Our Lord Himself underwent temptation. We overcome temptation. We don’t undergo temptation.</p>

<p>We can also count on the fact that in the face of temptation we are never alone. We have the Communion of Saints.</p>

<p>Our Lord wants us in these moments to acknowledge our humility, our weakness, and to run with more intensity to prayer and flee from the occasions; at the same time, counting on them, because they are part of the way to sanctity.</p>

<p>Our Lord has already triumphed. We have all the means. We can unite ourselves to His victory.</p>

<p>Every temptation that we overcome strengthens our soul and increases our grace.</p>

<p>Our Lord often was alone in solitude with God. His praying reminds us of the need we too have, to often seek those moments of solitude where we can be alone with God and pray.</p>

<p>“Count it all for joy,” says St. James, “when you fall into different temptations. Knowing that the trying of your faith works patience” (James 1:2-3).</p>

<p>There are many times in Scripture where the benefit of temptation is mentioned.</p>

<p>“Blessed is the person,” also says St. James, “that endures temptation; for when he has been proven he shall receive the crown of life” (James 1:12). Temptation is a pathway to glory and to victory.</p>

<p>St. Paul says, “He that thinks himself strong enough to stand, let him take heed lest he fall” (1 Cor. 10:12).</p>

<p>“God is faithful,” says St. Paul, “who will not suffer you to be tempted above what you’re able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that you may be able to bear it” (1 Cor. 10:13).</p>

<p>The devil is the father of lies (John 8:44). Lying is behaving like a child of Satan.</p>

<p>But when we realize that we’ve invited the devil into our house or that he’s cornered us in his cave, our response has to be to run back to God with an act of contrition. Those acts of contrition can be a constant in our life.</p>

<p>Did Jesus need to be tempted? Could He be tempted?</p>

<p>In some ways He didn’t need to be tempted. He was the God-Man. But by allowing Himself to be tempted by the devil, He instructs us how to overcome those temptations.</p>

<p>Tempting means testing: trying to improve something one is not sure about. It involves the possibility that the results may go one way or another.</p>

<p>As God, Jesus could not be tempted, but the devil did not know or was not sure that He was God. It’s unlikely that the devil knew about the doctrine of the Blessed Trinity, which was first revealed to Our Lady. As God-Man, there’s no possibility of failing the test. The devil did not know this.</p>

<p>Why did the God-Man agree to this Himself?</p>

<p>Not to be strengthened, as we might need due to weakness, but it was for our instruction that He allowed Himself to be tempted as we will be tempted and tested. And that testing is not bad; otherwise, He would not have agreed to it. Great benefit can come from that.</p>

<p>St. Padre Pio said that if we knew the merit that comes from overcoming temptation, we would welcome temptations (<em>cf</em>. Padre Pio, <em>Epistolario</em>).</p>

<p>There’s a great good to be gained from it. If we are to be like Him, we will go through the same.</p>

<p>If we are trying to lead holy lives, it’s very logical that the devil will try to knock us off our perch. We’re a big target for him. He wins a great battle if he can bring us down.</p>

<p>Our Lord has come to overcome the devil. The purpose of the Incarnation in some ways was to undo all the evil that the devil had done. St. John says this in his Letter: it was “to undo all that the devil has done that the Son of God appeared” (1 John 3:8).</p>

<p>It’s appropriate that Christ arranges a meeting with the devil, a duel, so that His overcoming Satan will be a pledge to our future success. It was truly a battle of the giants.</p>

<p>In the first temptation, we’re told that the devil tempted Jesus to eat bread: “Turn these stones into loaves of bread” (Matt. 4:3).</p>

<p>After forty days, Our Lord must have been really hungry, as anyone would be. The devil picks Him out at His weakest moment, and that’s what he does to us also.</p>

<p>Now, the Lord answers him with a phrase from Scripture: “Man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds from the mouth of God” (Matt. 4:4; Deut. 8:3).</p>

<p>It’s a reminder that we are on this journey ourselves, and we also have to rely on the word of God.</p>

<p>Christ doesn’t reject or disclaim that He’s hungry, but He raises the matter to a higher level.</p>

<p>We could also remind ourselves that He is truly the Word of God and He is going to give us the Bread of Life, one of the means to overcome all temptation.</p>

<p>Christ gives us the means. He’s there with us at every moment; He doesn’t leave us alone with the devil. He’s going to give us that Eternal Bread.</p>

<p>The first temptation is a temptation to do things for our own advantage only: “turn these stones into bread.” Eat. The test is on the passions and the needs of the body. Temptation is to care only for the passing food and forget about the eternal Word.</p>

<p>“Do not labor for the food that perishes, but for that which endures to eternal life” (John 6:27). It’s a temptation to rely on one’s own strength, but happiness of life has an eternal dimension.</p>

<p>There are three stages of temptation. There’s suggestion, there’s complacency, and there’s consent. Mortal sin only exists at the level of consent.</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter how many suggestions we may have on a daily basis—to our purity, to our laziness, to our disorder, to our charity, to our obedience, our vanity, our pride, our selfishness—as long as we try not to consent to them.</p>

<p>All the most important people in sacred history have been tempted: Adam, Eve, Abraham, Moses, Peter, and Paul.</p>

<p>By rejecting the temptations of the devil, Our Lord atones for the faults of those who went before Him and those who will come after. His reaction is an example for all the temptations we may have, to greed, to gluttony, to avarice.</p>

<p>He later teaches in the <em>Our Father</em> to ask God to help us with His grace not to fall into temptation: “Lead us not into temptation” (Matt. 6:13).</p>

<p>Before beginning His work as Messiah, Our Lord prepares by prayer and fasting. That’s what the forty days of Lent are all about. The devil makes use of this opportunity. As we begin our mission, we shouldn’t be surprised that the devil has a go at us.</p>

<p>He’s physically empty. This makes Him vulnerable. He could work a miracle, but it’s not part of God’s plan. He prefers to trust in His Father.</p>

<p>We also learn from this how we have to be careful in moments of vulnerability—when we’re low, when we’re tired, when we’re discouraged.</p>

<p>The devil seems to say to Him: How can you be the Son of God and still be hungry? How can your loving heavenly Father have allowed you to be hungry? How can He love you and yet permit this contradiction?</p>

<p>The devil may say the same thing to us in modern parlance: How can you be poor and yet still loved by your heavenly Father? Or unsuccessful? Or unemployed? Or a failure? Or have cancer? Or be in this concentration camp or this jail?</p>

<p>Or your child is in jail or has this incurable disease, and God still loves you? How can you be condemned to die with an incurable sickness? Or how can you have failed your driving test and God still loves you?</p>

<p>A lady came to me once from another country and said, “Father, why is God so cruel? Why does he treat me so roughly? Why does he hate me so much?”</p>

<p>I was wondering what terrible thing had happened in her life. And she said, “I’ve just failed my driving test for the eighth time!”</p>

<p>All the contradictions of life does not mean that God does not love us. We believe with faith that Our Heavenly Father is looking after us 24/7. We have every reason to reject these subtle temptations.</p>

<p>When the devil is stripped of all his disguises, the ultimate goal of the satanic is to avoid the Cross. To avoid self-denial. Avoid standing on our pride, on our selfishness, on our egoism. Avoid any form of mortification.</p>

<p>To this temptation Christ said, “Get behind me, Satan!” (Matt. 16:23).</p>

<p>The three temptations of Christ were worldly ways of avoiding the Cross. At the beginning of His public life, the devil tries to show Christ another way of saving the world.</p>

<p>The way that Our Lord answers the devil teaches us how to deal with temptation. He also teaches us that we shouldn’t ask God for things that we can obtain with our own efforts. God wants us to use the human means.</p>

<p>And we shouldn’t just ask Him for what is exclusively for our own convenience, but rather what will help towards our holiness and that of others.</p>

<p>Jesus says: I can be poor and still be loved. I can be loved and still be hungry. I can be blessed and still be empty. I can be precious to God and still unfulfilled.</p>

<p>He invites us to look to the Word of God for our fulfillment. “Not in bread alone does man live, but on every word that proceeds from the mouth of God” (Matt. 4:4).</p>

<p>It’s an act of trust in Fatherly Providence. God will not let Him die. He led Him to the desert to prepare Him for His mission.</p>

<p>St. Gregory the Great says if we consider how Our Lord let Himself be treated in the Passion, it’s not surprising that He let Himself be treated by the devil as He did (<em>cf</em>. Gregory I, <em>Homilies on the Gospels</em>, Homily 16). It’s all a preparation for what’s to come.</p>

<p>“Then the devil took him into the holy city and set him upon the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, ‘If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down; for it is written: He has given his angels charge over you, and in their hands they will bear you up, lest you dash your foot against the stone.’ Jesus said to him, ‘It is written again: You shall not tempt the Lord your God’” (Matt. 4:5-7; Deut. 6:16).</p>

<p>In the second temptation, the devil realizes that he hasn’t won the first time. Now he asks Him to enlist the help of the angels: “He has given his angels charge over you.” The devil quotes Sacred Scripture. Interesting.</p>

<p>The test now is the ego—to show that if one is powerful enough, that He can overcome all.</p>

<p>Christ responds, also quoting Scripture, telling him not to test God.</p>

<p>Every time we think we’re powerful enough to overcome an occasion of sin that we put ourselves in, we are testing God: ‘I’m strong enough to resist the temptation.’ ‘I can watch this movie.’ ‘I can look at this picture.’ ‘I can answer this call.’ ‘I can meet this person.’</p>

<p>When we can only find out, to our cost to us, we’re not as strong as we thought we were.</p>

<p>The Church teaches us to flee from occasions of sin. “If your hand is an occasion of sin to you, cut it off” (<em>cf</em>. Matt. 5:30).</p>

<p>Christ is very radical. He doesn’t say take one long, last, lingering, loving look at your hand, and then kiss your hand goodbye, and make sure that your hand feels very good about it. Christ said, “Cut it off.”</p>

<p>We can ask Our Lord for the fortitude to cut the temptations, to distance ourselves from the occasions of sin, the subtle ways in which the devil comes to us.</p>

<p>When he says to us: Don’t worry, you’re strong; you’re a child of God; nothing will happen; so many of your friends have done the same; you’re a good Christian of proven virtue; surely there’s no sin in entertaining yourself—God is there to help us. By the way, in case you forget, He has even sent His angel.</p>

<p>We have an angel to take care of us. He needs to occupy himself a little bit with our care. The devil says let him do the necessary.</p>

<p>The devil says, “He will send his angel so that you don’t get hurt” (<em>cf</em>. Matt. 4:6). But over and above all this, Our Lord says, “You should not tempt the Lord your God” (Matt. 4:7; Deut. 6:16).</p>

<p>We can fly to the care of the angels for our help in moments of temptation. The <em>Prayer to St. Michael</em> is a prayer the Church recommends to say every day, particularly after Mass, and in all dangers and temptations.</p>

<p>Or the <em>Memorare</em> prayer to Our Lady when we feel things are getting hot. It’s a very good prayer to teach your children to make them aware of the devil, and to see how we shouldn’t be asking Our Lord for extraordinary help, when He wants us to avoid the occasions of sin ourselves—to see where the devil may be lurking, to see where the dangers are, to be clever. “The prudent of this world must be children of the light, not children of darkness” (Luke 16:8).</p>

<p>We know that God will help us when there’s no other way, but God is not a remedy for our laziness or our refusal to try.</p>

<p>The whole of Lent reminds us of the importance of struggle. The Old Testament says, “The life of man on earth is a struggle” (<em>cf</em>. Job 7:1). God wants us to struggle like He struggled on the way to Calvary. He fell down three times, but He got up again.</p>

<p>In this temptation the devil quotes Scripture. He sets himself up as an interpreter of Scripture. It’s a reminder to us to reject any interpretation of Scripture that is not in keeping with the teaching of the Church, stressing certain passages to the exclusion of others.</p>

<p>The Magisterium of the Church, guided by the Holy Spirit, is the one divine interpreter of Sacred Scripture. “All power in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go you, therefore, teach all nations” (Matt. 28:18-19). It’s the teaching power of the Church, guided by the Holy Spirit, that gives us the truth that is in Scripture.</p>

<p>The second temptation is temptation to the spectacular, the extraordinary. “Cast yourself down from the pinnacle of the temple.” Throw yourself out into the air. Do this publicity stunt. Anything to draw the crowd. Be like Superman, Batman, Spiderman.</p>

<p>The devil can also say that to us: Forget the ordinary. Be immersed in the extraordinary. Look for all sorts of extraordinary things.</p>

<p>But we know from Scripture that the ordinary passes unnoticed, like Jesus in Nazareth.</p>

<p>Some people may only believe in God and in Our Lady when they see spectacular things, miracles, apparitions, when they hear God speaking through the crowds, or when they see stigmata.</p>

<p>But Jesus bids us to look for the extraordinary in the ordinary.</p>

<p>The life of a Christian, when he has faith—when he works, when he rests, when he prays—in all moments, is always supernatural. It’s a life in which God is always present with reason enlightened by faith.</p>

<p>Our Lord rejects the [second] temptation as He did the first: “You shall not tempt the Lord your God.”</p>

<p>To tempt God is the opposite of trusting Him. We shouldn’t ask Him for extraordinary help, putting ourselves in dangerous situations: diving off some cliff into the ocean; driving when we’ve taken a drink or two; dilly-dallying with occasions of sin, with certain movies, or our phone, or people—things that we know are a danger for us.</p>

<p>We all have different temptations, different weaknesses. One man’s meat can be another man’s poison. We have to know what we have to be careful with.</p>

<p>And then there is the third temptation. “Again, the devil took him up a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them, and said to him, ‘All these will I give you, if falling down you will adore me.’ And Jesus said to him, ‘Be gone, Satan! For it is written: The Lord your God shall you adore, and him only shall you serve.’ Then the devil left him; and behold, angels came and ministered to him” (Matt. 4:8-11).</p>

<p>The third temptation is a temptation to possessions, to have power and glory. He “showed him all the kingdoms of the world.” It’s a temptation to have material things, to social status, to power—temptation to have plenty of dreams of how great it would be to possess the world, or at least half of it.</p>

<p>But the Lord seems to say that happiness does not come from material possessions. It comes from choosing God; at times, choosing the cross, following the pathway of our Christian vocation. Not from doing things that are easy.</p>

<p>We only get momentary happiness from possessions or some material thing. But that is passing and can leave us with a bitter sadness, like that of the rich young man who “went his way sad, because he had great possessions” (Matt. 19:16-22). He clung to his riches.</p>

<p>He could have been an apostle. He could have been one of the great instruments that Our Lord used to build His Church, but he did not want.</p>

<p>Our Lord invites us to let our dreams be on what is necessary to lead a decent life. “Do not labor for the food that perishes, but for that which endures to eternal life” (John 6:27). The rest is from the evil one.</p>

<p>Don’t just focus on desiring riches, or success, or money, or power, or glory. Don’t be like people who actually adore Satan in his many forms.</p>

<p>Sometimes the devil keeps his word. He gives them riches. He provokes Christ to take on the role of an earthly Messiah, a pseudo-Messiah: Identify yourself with the world. Do what is popular. Worship me for I am its prince.</p>

<p>St. Paul says, “Do not conform your mind to the ways of this world” (Rom. 12:2).</p>

<p>Christ invites us to be different—at times to clash with our environment, to stick our neck out. To be a leader. To be a conscientious objector, if necessary. To be different to everybody else.</p>

<p>There was a Dutch missionary priest in Singapore who used to tell newly baptized adults in his parish every year—there were sixty of them—“Now that you’re Catholics you have to be different. You can’t be the same as everybody else, because we’ve come to change this world. A Christian has to stand out.”</p>

<p>The devil says to the apostle: Don’t be unpopular. Don’t be different from your colleagues. Don’t clash with your environment. Take it easy.</p>

<p>It’s a temptation to reduce the God-given transcendental mission to a purely human and political one. It’s a reminder to the Church and to each one to remain faithful to its God-given mission in the world.</p>

<p>Fulton Sheen used to say, “Whoever marries the spirit of the world in this generation becomes a widow in the next” (Fulton J. Sheen, <em>Sermon</em>, September 22, 1940).</p>

<p>Our Lord replies: “Be gone, Satan! For it is written, the Lord your God you shall adore and him only shall you serve” (Matt. 4:10; Deut. 6:13). There’s an uncompromising rejection of an earthly messianism. Our Lord rejects all human glory.</p>

<p>We’re reminded too that although God had the right to be treated as a God, He took the form of a slave. “He emptied himself” (Phil. 2:7).</p>

<p>We can learn from the attitude of Jesus in these trials. The absence of earthly glory and the blessings of God are not incompatible. If we struggle constantly, we’ll attain victory.</p>

<p>We’re told that “the devil left him and behold, angels came and ministered to him.” Nobody is crowned without having first conquered. The coming of the angels teaches us the interior joy given by God to the person who fights energetically.</p>

<p>Our guardian angels are powerful defenders against temptations. Teach your children to invoke their guardian angel every day.</p>

<p>It is the temptation to identify fidelity to God with success in the eyes of the world. It’s difficult to believe that we’re special and loved by God even when we’re hungry or empty or unfulfilled; when we’re not successful in the eyes of the world.</p>

<p>“We’re not tempted because we’re evil, but because we’re human. There’s nothing intrinsically evil about human nature just because the devil knocks at the door. Evil begins when we open the door and consent to the temptation. Scripture praises the man who suffers temptations.” Job went through many temptations. “When we resist temptation, we strengthen our character” (Fulton J. Sheen, <em>Life Is Worth Living).</em></p>

<p>We need to be careful with temptations so that we don’t fall away from our ideals—the ideals of holiness, of our vocation, the ideals of our apostolate. We’ve come to change the world.</p>

<p>Sometimes we could thank Our Lord for the temptations that He permits in our life. Helps us to know our weaknesses, where we need to struggle.</p>

<p>Our Lord allowed Himself to be tempted, so we can’t be surprised if we’re tempted also.</p>

<p>St. Paul says to Timothy: “He is not crowned, except he who strives lawfully” (2 Tim. 2:5). “Blessed is the person who endures temptation, for when he has been proven, he will receive the crown of life” (James 1:12).</p>

<p>Tried in temptation, virtue grows and increases in firmness (<em>cf</em>. Leo I, <em>Sermon 39</em>).</p>

<p>We know that Our Lady “crushed the head of the serpent” (Gen. 3:15). In moments of temptation, we can turn to Our Mother and ask her for all the strength that we need, to ask her for the help to realize that every urge, every craving is not necessarily a worthy one.</p>

<p>The drug addict hungers for their next high, but we know that all drugs in that sense are bad for you. Saying no to temptation seems to go against the go-for-it philosophy that many people in society promote.</p>

<p>Even our body and mind seem to fight as we deprive it of the fuel it hungers for, regardless of whether that fuel is good or bad for our spiritual and emotional welfare.</p>

<p>Mary, help me to see where my weaknesses lie, and to be wise and prudent to use that information to my best advantage.</p>

<p>The good news is that the more we say no to temptation and ungodly desires, the more we actually strengthen those weak spots. God doesn’t want us to run and hide from temptation, but to face it head on so that we may clearly see the potential pit before us.</p>

<p>Mary, help us to confess our sins, to admit our weaknesses, and to ask God for the strength and the wisdom we need to stand against all evil.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p>(<em>Proofread</em>)</p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>Our Lord will always enlighten those who seek Him with a clean heart. To think about the life of St. Joseph is to discover a life full of joys and sorrows. Our Lord teaches us through the life of the Holy Patriarch that true happiness is never far from the Cross. If we bear suffering and trial with supernatural spirit, we will soon be rewarded with clarity and peace. With Christ at our side, sorrows turn into joys.</p>

<p>The Gospel relates the first sorrow and first joy of St. Joseph. We’re told, “When Mary his mother had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit” (Matt. 1:18).</p>

<p>Joseph was well aware of the holiness of his spouse, even though he could not understand the evident fact of her maternity. He was deeply perplexed. He loved Our Lady with a pure and deep human love. Yet he felt obliged by his upright conscience to follow the Mosaic Law in this regrettable situation.</p>

<p>In order to protect Mary from public shame, Joseph decided to put her away privately. This was a most painful test for both Joseph and Mary.</p>

<p>Just as his sorrow was great, so was Joseph’s joy immeasurable when at last he was shown the ways of God’s Providence. We’re told, “But while he thought on these things…” (Matt. 1:20).</p>

<p>These were the things that he could not hope to fathom, that he was unable to share with anyone. In the midst of this trial Joseph was visited by an angel, who said: “Do not be afraid, Joseph, son of David, to take to you Mary your wife, for that which is begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit” (<em>ibid</em>.).</p>

<p>All of Joseph’s doubts vanished at once. Everything had become clear. His soul had become filled with God’s peace. He now understood that he was the recipient of two incredible treasures, Jesus and Mary. He had been given for his wife the Mother of God. He had been given for a son the Son of God.</p>

<p>Joseph had become a different person. John Paul II says, “He became a unique guardian of the mystery ‘hidden for ages in God’ (Eph. 3:9)” (John Paul II, Apostolic Exhortation, <em>Redemptoris custos</em>, Point 5, August 15, 1989).</p>

<p>We can learn from Joseph’s first sorrow and joy that Our Lord will always enlighten those who seek Him with a clean heart. God’s light can shine through the most perplexing situations imaginable.</p>

<p>How often does it happen that we fail to grasp the meaning of God’s plans, the ‘why’ behind different circumstances and events. If we take care to trust in Our Lord, we will come to appreciate His divine wisdom. With that realization we will discover a deep sense of peace and joy in our soul.</p>

<p>A few months later, Joseph and Mary set off from Nazareth to Bethlehem to enroll in the census decreed by Caesar Augustus (<em>cf</em>. Luke 2:1). After this three or four-day journey, they were tired and worn out. This must have been especially true of Our Lady, a mother with child.</p>

<p>They had arrived at the town of their forefathers but they had no place to stay. There was no room for them at the inn. There was no home for them anywhere.</p>

<p>We can imagine Joseph going from door to door in search of shelter and hospitality for his pregnant wife. At each door he would have made the same simple request: ‘We have just arrived in town. My wife is about to deliver a child.’</p>

<p>Everywhere he must have received the same negative reply. Our Lady was probably close by on their donkey, a silent witness to this trying search.</p>

<p>What must this experience have been like for St. Joseph? What must have been his feelings at the sight of his weary wife, her clothing travel-stained, and every feature proclaiming her utter exhaustion?</p>

<p>Eventually they learned of some caves on the outskirts of the town. Joseph took Our Lady to one of those places which served as a stable. Our Lady could go no farther. “And it came to pass while they were there, that the days for her to be delivered were fulfilled. And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger” (Luke 2:6-7).</p>

<p>All of the anxiety and suffering that was there in that journey was quickly forgotten from the moment that Our Lady held the Son of God in her arms. St. Joseph would have realized that the Son of God was now his son as well. He would have kissed Him and worshipped Him.</p>

<p>In the midst of this simplicity and poverty, a multitude of the heavenly host appeared and proclaimed: “Glory to God in the highest” (Luke 2:14).</p>

<p>One writer says Our Lady experienced a great joy in these moments, and St. Joseph participated in her happiness. He contemplated the way she looked upon her Son, the way she spoke to Him, the way she watched over Him with loving reverence (<em>cf</em>. Federico Suarez, <em>Joseph of Nazareth</em>).</p>

<p>This alternating sorrow and joy should teach us that serving God is worth the effort, even though we will encounter difficulties, and perhaps poverty and pain. In the final analysis, a single look from Our Lady will more than make up for the little and not-so-little sufferings which may come our way.</p>

<p>We’re told in St. Luke, “When eight days were fulfilled for his circumcision, his name was called Jesus, the name given him by the angel before he was conceived in the womb” (Luke 2:21).</p>

<p>By means of this rite, each male was initiated into the community of the Chosen People. The ceremony took place either in the paternal home or in the local synagogue. The boy’s name was imposed at this time. The actual ceremony was sometimes performed by his father.</p>

<p>The giving of names had a special significance for the Jewish people. The name Jesus means <em>Savior</em>; it had been chosen by God Himself and communicated through the message of the angel: “You shall call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins” (Matt. 1:21).</p>

<p>It was the desire of the Holy Trinity that the Son should commence His salvific mission on earth in suffering. It would seem fitting that Joseph was the one to inaugurate the mystery of the Redemption by shedding the first drops of his Son’s holy blood.</p>

<p>One writer said this blood would yield its full effect in the awful context of the Passion (<em>cf</em>. Michel Gasnier, <em>Joseph the Silent</em>). The child who cried upon the receipt of His name had thereupon begun His work of salvation.</p>

<p>St. Joseph was himself pained at the sight of these first drops of blood. He was well versed in the Scriptures, and he knew, if only in an imperfect way, that there would come a day when his Son would have to shed His blood even to the last drop.</p>

<p>Joseph was filled with joy to carry the child in his arms and call Him Jesus, a name which countless people would later repeat with awe, with profound respect, and devotion. Joseph was always aware of the mystery involved in that name.</p>

<p>We’re told in St. Luke, “And when the days of her purification were fulfilled according to the Law of Moses, they took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord” (Luke 2:22). The Temple was to be the setting for the purification of Our Lady and the presentation of Our Lord, as prescribed by the Mosaic Law.</p>

<p>Upon their arrival at the Temple, the Holy Family were met by an elderly man called Simeon who was inspired by the Holy Spirit. Simeon took the child into his arms and with immense joy he praised God.</p>

<p>Simeon prophesied that this young child would become a “sign of contradiction” which many would obstinately reject. He foretold that Mary would be intimately united with the redemptive work of her Son. “A sword” would pass through her heart (<em>cf</em>. Luke 2:25-35).</p>

<p>This sword signifies a deep and lasting wound. Mary then understood the immensity of her Son’s sacrifice as well as the immensity of her own. The sorrow in this sacrifice was to be all the greater because some would reject as unwanted the graces won for them by her Son.</p>

<p>The prophecy of Simeon, one writer said, “the sword in the heart of Mary is also the sword in the heart of Joseph, since they were of one heart, <em>cor unum et anima una</em>, one heart and one soul. This sword represents the battle for or against Jesus. Mary is, therefore, directly tied…to the many diverse acts which constitute the history of mankind. It should be evident to us, however, that Joseph is also heavily involved in this struggle inasmuch as he was a loyal and loving husband” (Leon Cristiani, <em>St. Joseph, Patron of the Universal Church</em>).</p>

<p>When Joseph heard the prophecy of Simeon, surely a sword must have pierced his heart as well.</p>

<p>On that day in the Temple Joseph and Mary were given a more profound insight into the mystery of the Redemption which their Son would bring to completion. St. Joseph was now able to understand a little better the sorrow of his wife and Son. He made this suffering his own. He would probably never have forgotten the words that he heard in the Temple that morning.</p>

<p>Alongside the pain there must also have been the joy of impending universal redemption. Jesus was the salvation “prepared before the face of all peoples: a light of revelation to the Gentiles, and a glory for your people Israel” (Luke 2:31-32). No pain is greater than beholding a stubborn resistance to grace. No joy is comparable to understanding that the Redemption is being carried out in our time and that many souls are coming close to Christ.</p>

<p>We’ve all experienced the joy when a friend has returned to the sacrament of Penance, or when a friend has given his or her life to God without conditions.</p>

<p>One writer says: “O most holy and lovable Virgin! Help us to share in the sufferings of Jesus as you yourself did. Help us to have a profound horror of sin, an even greater desire for holiness, and a generous love for Jesus and his Cross. We would like to make reparation through our acts of love for your great sufferings and humiliations” (Adolphe Tanqueray, <em>The Divinization of Suffering</em>).</p>

<p>We can ask St. Joseph, our father and lord, to help us by his powerful intercession to bring Jesus to many people who live out their lives apart from Him.</p>

<p>St. Joseph was the custodian of Jesus and Mary, a father and spouse—foster father of Jesus and husband of Our Lady, the Mother of God. He was the person who was closest to Our Lord on earth after His Mother, the legal and practical father of Jesus.</p>

<p>The angel tells him to name the child Jesus; this was a right found only for fathers. He was the person who worked, suffered, and most cared for Jesus after Our Lady.</p>

<p>Our Lord must have been eternally grateful for all the things that he did for Him. He must have given him a great heaven. That’s why many fathers of the Church think that after Mary, he is the greatest. Together with Our Lord and Our Lady, he forms with them the Trinity on earth.</p>

<p>He must have taught Jesus, the Son of God, to work, to read, to write. He must have taught Him ways of speaking that must come out in the parables.</p>

<p>He was called in a special way to fulfill these two tasks: custodian of Jesus and Mary. In that vocation, all his other graces find their reason for being.</p>

<p>St. Jerome assigns some reasons for Mary’s espousal to Joseph: so that the ancestry of Mary be demonstrated by the genealogy of Joseph; so that she would not be stoned by the Jews as an adulteress; so that in her running away to Egypt she may have support; and the martyr Ignatius adds even a further reason: so that the birth of Christ may be hidden from the devil (<em>cf</em>. Jerome, <em>Against Helvidius</em>).</p>

<p>Joseph deemed himself unworthy of the Virgin Mother’s company. He trembled on beholding that she bore in her womb the Divinity Incarnate. He couldn’t fathom the mystery (Mary of Agreda, <em>The Mystical City of God</em>).</p>

<p>The angel tells us of the emotion of Joseph, which was fear (Matt. 1:20). In Scripture, the just men, when faced with divine mysteries, always express fear. If he suspected Mary of unfaithfulness, probably the emotion would not have been fear.</p>

<p>St. Josemaría loved St. Joseph so much that in his last years he used to say that his love grew in an impetuous manner (<em>cf</em>. Andrés Vázquez de Prada, <em>The Founder of Opus Dei</em>, Volume III). Each day that went by, he said that he loved him with a new impetus that was capable of overcoming all difficulties.</p>

<p>Why? Because God had reserved for St. Joseph the highest place that was possible to occupy after that of Our Lord and Our Lady.</p>

<p>God asked St. Joseph for something very big. Our Lady was the Mother of God, and he had the mission of covering up the miraculous maternity of his wife.</p>

<p>Jesus had to be a man like any other, so it was necessary for Joseph to be there. It was necessary for Joseph to participate in the game, you might say, in this divine game, and that he should be “a just man,” as Scripture says (Matt. 1:19)—a man who loved the will of God, and who always tried to put it into practice. The name of Joseph means “increase” (<em>cf</em>. Gen. 30:24).</p>

<p>For St. Joseph, the life of Jesus was a continuous discovery of his own vocation. As a light, the vocation is a maturing in the faith. It means growing in the life of grace. It doesn’t exclude all traces of obscurity, which are proper to the life of faith on earth. It fills one’s entire life.</p>

<p>For many people who approach God, it’s a light that sheds meaning on their lives. It’s a possibility that they discover in the depths of their being a light that gives meaning to their life so far and opens horizons for the future. By the light of faith, the person discovers God’s call to follow Him.</p>

<p>As an impulse, the vocation is a blossoming of charity, and therefore of freedom. God’s call and a person’s response mean the beginning of a transforming friendship (Hans Urs von Balthasar, <em>Vocation</em>).</p>

<p>St. Josemaría says, “St. Joseph, more than anyone else before or since, learned from Jesus to be alert to recognize the wonders of God, to have his mind and heart awake” (Josemaría Escrivá, <em>Christ Is Passing By</em>, Point 54).</p>

<p>We imitate St. Joseph by sanctifying our professional work. If our work is the work of a carpenter, then that’s the one we’re going to sanctify. If it’s that of an intellectual, man or woman, then that’s the one we’re going to sanctify. Which is more important, St. Josemaría would ask. The answer would be, “the one which is done with more love of God.” It is the love of God that gives divine importance to human things (<em>cf</em>. J. Escrivá, <em>Friends of God</em>, Point 55).</p>

<p>In that, St. Joseph gave us a great lesson. The call from God is a grace of Our Lord. A gift. A choice made by divine goodness.</p>

<p>Many young people change their lives when they decide to follow Our Lord. We can see them progress in their interior lives in a way that might previously have seemed unimaginable.</p>

<p>With faith come morals. By the light of faith, we can recognize in this change of life a sign of God’s call as He touches the soul and prepares it to fulfill the mission on which it is set out.</p>

<p>This is a lasting impulse, an interior grace which lasts a lifetime. St. Josemaría liked to say that perseverance in a vocation is the clearest sign of its divinity (<em>cf</em>. J. Escrivá, <em>The Way</em>, Point 983).</p>

<p>Vocation is a deep personal adherence that affects the whole person throughout their life. It grows with the person. Insofar as it is a free and irrevocable choice, it constantly helps one mature and produce the fruits of perseverance.</p>

<p>As a light and an impulse, the vocation exists at the level of theological faith. This means that even though it’s a special gift from God, and it’s important that it’s always perceived and presented in this way, recognizing it does not require extraordinary manifestations except in extraordinary circumstances.</p>

<p>St. Josemaría has said we cannot doubt that we have been deliberately chosen to be co-redeemers. Along with all the other reasons we have often considered, we have an external sign: the fact that we have been laboring so willingly in his work for no earthly gain.</p>

<p>In St. John, we’re told “The wind blows where it wills, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know whence it comes or whither it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit” (John 3:8).</p>

<p>Msgr. Fernando Ocáriz, Prelate of Opus Dei, has said, “While faith tells an individual that there is a general vocation to sanctity—communion with God in Jesus Christ—the existence of a special vocation for oneself is not the direct object of theological faith; it comes from natural knowledge of signs which, when seen in the light of grace of that special vocation, lead the mind to a moral certainty that one is being called.</p>

<p>“The fact that God (normally) does not impose a special vocation as an evident truth allows us to think that he wants the person’s freedom to come into play not only in the moment of answering the call, but in its shaping as well” (Pedro Rodriguez, Fernando Ocáriz, and Jose Luis Illanes, <em>Opus Dei in the Church</em>).</p>

<p>There are also some attitudes that are good to nurture in souls to equip them to recognize a call from God and give themselves: generosity, cheerful self-giving, and especially loving as Christ taught; awareness of the grandeur of being part of something greater than ourselves, that is, the beauty that surrounds the mystery of the Church and our participation in it.</p>

<p>In a climate of individualistic hedonism, these attitudes cannot always be taken for granted. In many cases, it’s an encounter with the mission for which one seems particularly suited, and with which one can identify with one’s own talents and aspirations, which sets the spark of vocational light in the soul. Each of the enormous varieties of different vocations found in the Church draws its specificity not from the level of holiness acquired—because one and all are called to holiness—but rather from the particular ecclesial mission that each one is invited to carry out.</p>

<p>This responsibility can then take focus in a thousand different ways. God’s call is doubtlessly the fullest response, as beautiful as it is demanding, to the aspirations born in a young heart.</p>

<p>In <em>The Forge</em>, St. Josemaría says “Committed! How I love that word!” (J. Escrivá, <em>The Forge</em>, Point 855). St. Joseph led a life of commitment. He obviously had a great love for his vocation. Each one of us should have a great love for our vocation. It is the best.</p>

<p>We can ask him to help us to foster a sincere desire for holiness, to desire that goal of our vocation. Sanctity is continuously doing what God wants, not what we want. We have to try and work at our vocation every day, to polish up that vocation, to keep the message of our vocation very clear on a day-to-day basis.</p>

<p>With all these things, we see a great example in St. Joseph. “How I love that word!” St. Josemaría says, “We children of God freely put ourselves under an obligation to live a life of dedication to God, striving that he may have complete and absolute sovereignty over our lives” (<em>ibid</em>.).</p>

<p>We can ask St. Joseph to help us to live out our vocation in the ways that God wants us each day of our life. From our meditation on his vocation, may we come to give ourselves in a greater way on a day-to-day basis.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

Conor Donnelly</p>

<p><em>(Proofread)</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here. That you see me, and that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins, and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>Devotion to the Sacred Heart already existed in the Middle Ages as a private devotion. It appears as a liturgical feast in 1675, following the apparitions of Our Lord to Saint Margaret Mary Alacoque. In these revelations, the saint was given to know with special depth the need to make reparation for her personal sins and for the sins of the whole world, and to respond to Christ’s love.</p>

<p>Our Lord asked her to extend the practice of frequent Communion, especially on the first Friday of every month, in a spirit of reparation. He asked for the first Friday after the octave of Corpus Christi to be dedicated as a special feast to glorify His heart.</p>

<p>The feast was celebrated for the first time on the 21st of June, 1686. Pius IX extended it to the whole Church. In 1928, Pius XI gave it the splendor that it has today.</p>

<p>Beneath the symbol of the human heart of Jesus, we consider above all the infinite love of Christ for each individual soul. This is why devotion to the Sacred Heart stems from the principles of Christian doctrine, as Pope John Paul II has made clear in his abundant teaching about this consoling mystery.</p>

<p>In the entrance antiphon, we’re told that the designs of His heart shall endure from age to age, to rescue our souls from death and nourish us in our hunger.</p>

<p>There’s a twofold aspect to the solemnity that we celebrate today. On the one hand, there is thanksgiving for the wonder of God’s love for us. On the other, there is reparation. Because this love is often poorly responded to, or scarcely repaid. Even by those who have so many reasons for loving and thanking God.</p>

<p>The basis of Christian piety has always been the consideration of Christ’s love for all men. This is why devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus stems from the principles of Christian doctrine, says Pope Pius XII.</p>

<p>This devotion received a special impulse from the devotion and piety of many saints to whom Our Lord disclosed the secrets of His most loving heart, moving them to spread devotion to the Sacred Heart and to foster a spirit of reparation.</p>

<p>On the Friday after the octave of the feast of Corpus Christi, Our Lord asked Saint Margaret Mary to promote love for frequent Communion, especially on the first Friday of every month, in a spirit of reparation. He promised that He would let her share each Thursday to Friday night in His suffering in the Garden of Olives.</p>

<p>One year later, Our Lord appeared to her, laying bare His most Sacred Heart. He spoke to her in words that have nourished the piety of many souls. He said, “See this Heart that has loved men so much and has spared itself nothing, until it has exhausted itself and consumed itself in order to show them its love. I receive in return scarcely anything but ingratitude because of their irreverence and sacrileges, and because of the coldness and disdain they show towards Me in this Sacrament of Love.”</p>

<p>“But what hurts me still more is that it is hearts who are consecrated to Me who treat Me in this way. This is why I ask you that on the first Friday after the octave of Corpus Christi, a special feast may be dedicated to the honor of My heart, by receiving Communion on that day and making reparation with some act of atonement.”</p>

<p>Pope Saint John Paul II has said that in many parts of the Church, there exists the private custom of making reparation on the first Friday of the month with some Eucharistic act or by saying the Litany of the Sacred Heart. Moreover, the month of June is dedicated in a special way to the veneration of the Divine Heart. Not just on one day, the liturgical feast which generally falls in June, but every day.</p>

<p>The heart of Jesus is the source and expression of His infinite love for each person, whatever the person’s situation may be. Our Lord seeks out each one of us.</p>

<p>A beautiful text taken from the prophet Ezekiel says, “I am going to look after my flock myself, and keep all of it in view. As a shepherd keeps all his flock in sight when he stands up in the middle of his scattered sheep, so shall I keep my sheep in view. I shall rescue them from wherever they may have been scattered during the mist and darkness” (Ezek. 34:11–12).</p>

<p>Each person is an individual whom the Father has entrusted to the Son, so that he or she shall not perish, even though they may have strayed far away.</p>

<p>Jesus, true God and true man, loves the world with a human heart, says the Second Vatican Council. A heart that serves as a channel for God’s infinite love. Nobody has ever loved more than Jesus does. Nobody ever will love us more.</p>

<p>Saint Paul said to the Galatians, “He loved me and gave himself up for me” (Gal. 2:20). Each one of us can repeat those words. His heart is full of the Father’s love, full in a way that is at once both divine and human.</p>

<p>Christ’s heart loved as no other heart has ever loved. He experienced sadness and joy, compassion and sorrow. The Evangelists frequently tell us of the feelings of Jesus. As in Saint Mark where he says, “I have compassion on the crowd” (Mark 8:2). He had compassion on them because they were like sheep without a shepherd.</p>

<p>The successful outcome of His apostles’ first venture into evangelization made Him feel as we do when we receive some good news. Saint Luke says, “He rejoiced” (Luke 10:21). In Saint John, He weeps when death takes His friend from Him. Neither does Our Lord hide His disappointment—“Jerusalem, Jerusalem, killing the prophets. How often I would have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood, but you did not want to” (Matt. 23:37). How often.</p>

<p>Jesus sees the whole history of the Old Testament and of mankind, a portion of the Jewish people and of the Gentiles of all times, who will reject God’s love and mercy. We can say that in this passage, God is somehow weeping with human eyes for the sorrow He feels in His human heart. This is the real meaning of devotion to the Sacred Heart, to translate God’s nature into human terms for ourselves. It’s not a matter of indifference to Jesus, any less than is our daily relationship with Him at the present time. That some lepers fail to return to thank Him, after they had been cured.</p>

<p>He’s not indifferent to the hospitality and consideration shown towards a guest, as He told Simon the Pharisee. On many occasions, He experienced the great joy of seeing someone repent of his sins and become His disciple. Or also of seeing the generosity of those who left everything to follow Him.</p>

<p>He was affected by the joy of blind men who are able to see perhaps for the first time in their lives. Before celebrating the Last Supper, He was already thinking that He would remain with us forever by means of the Blessed Eucharist that He was about to institute. “I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer” (Luke 22:15).</p>

<p>This emotion must have been even stronger when He took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to His disciples, saying, “This is My body” (Luke 22:19). Who shall ever be able to express the feelings in His most loving heart, as He gave His mother to us on Calvary to be our mother?</p>

<p>When He had already surrendered His life to His Father, one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and at once there came out blood and water (cf. John 19:34). This open wound reminds us today of the immense love that Jesus has for us. Because He willingly gave the very last drop of His precious blood for us. As though each of us were alone in the world.</p>

<p>Are we not then going to approach Christ with confidence? What amount of wretchedness can prevent our loving Him, so long as our heart is big enough to ask for forgiveness?</p>

<p>After He had ascended into Heaven in His glorified body, Christ did not cease to love us. He doesn’t stop calling us now, to live always close to His most loving heart. Even in the glory of Heaven, in His hands and feet and side, He bears glowing marks of the wounds which represent the triple victory gained by Him over the devil, sin, and death.</p>

<p>Pius XII says He likewise has in His heart, placed as it were in a most precious shrine, those treasures of merit, the fruits of His triple triumph. These He bestows generously on redeemed mankind.</p>

<p>Today, on this solemnity, we adore the most Sacred Heart of Jesus. Since that heart of His participates in and is the natural and most expressive symbol of the inexhaustible love with which our divine Redeemer still loves mankind. That heart indeed, although it is no longer liable to the disturbances of this mortal life, still lives and beats. It is now inseparably joined with the Person of the Divine Word, and in it and through it with His divine will.</p>

<p>Wherefore, says Pope Pius XII, since the heart of Christ overflows with divine and human love, and since it is abundantly rich with the treasures of all the graces our Redeemer acquired by His life, His sufferings, and His death, it is truly the unfailing fountain of that love which His Spirit pours forth into all the members of His mystical body.</p>

<p>As we meditate today on the love that Christ has for us, we will feel a desire to thank Him for such a great gift and for so much unmerited mercy. As we consider how so very many turn their backs on God, let us remember that often we ourselves are not altogether faithful. That we have many personal weaknesses.</p>

<p>We should turn then to His most loving heart, where we shall find peace. We often need to have recourse to His merciful love, and to seek that peace which is one of the fruits given us by the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>We can say that aspiration Saint Josemar’a liked so much: “Cor Iesu Sacratissimum et Misericors, dona nobis pacem.” Most sweet and merciful heart of Jesus, grant us peace. As we see Jesus so close to our concerns, to our problems, to our ideals, we can say to Him in the words of the <em>Furrow</em>: “I give you thanks, my Jesus, for your decision to become perfect man, with a heart which loves and is most lovable. Which loved unto death and suffered. Which was filled with joy and sorrow. Which delighted in the things of men, and showed us the way to Heaven. Which subjected itself heroically to duty, and acted with mercy. Which watched over the poor and the rich, and cared for the sinner and the just alike. I give you thanks, my Jesus. Give us hearts that will measure up to yours.”</p>

<p>We are told in Saint John that after Jesus had taken the wine, He said, “It is fulfilled” (John 19:30), and bowing His head, He gave up His spirit. We are reminded that joy is compatible with mortification and pain.</p>

<p>Chesterton said that of all the accounts that are given of Jesus on the cross, one that is missing is the account of the joy of Jesus on the cross, in the fact that it is accomplished.</p>

<p>The prophet Isaiah says, “Rejoice with Jerusalem and be glad for her, all you who love her” (Isa. 66:10). Joy is essentially a Christian characteristic. The Church does not fail to remind us that it should be present at every moment of our lives. As we look at the Sacred Heart of Jesus, we can be reminded that that’s the place for us to find our joys.</p>

<p>All people with broken hearts can find solace in the broken heart of Christ on the cross. Fulton Sheen liked to say that when God allows hearts to be broken, it’s because He wants to enter into them a little more. But you just have to give Him all the pieces.</p>

<p>We get a profound joy of being united to Christ. Only in Him can each of us say with Saint Paul, “He loved me and gave Himself up for me” (Gal. 2:20). John Paul II said this should be the source of our greatest happiness, as well as the source of our strength and support, should we have the misfortune to encounter sorrow, undergo suffering, experience misunderstanding, or even to fall into sin.</p>

<p>We can always turn to the one who always loves us. With His infinite love as God, He overcomes every trial, fills our emptiness, forgives all our sins, and eagerly impels us toward a new path that is safe and joyful. The Church wants to remind us that joy is perfectly compatible with mortification and pain.</p>

<p>It is sadness and not penance which is opposed to happiness. The Church can be filled with joy, and each one of us. “Rejoice with Jerusalem,” we’re told, “and be glad for her, all you who love her” (Isa. 66:10). The mortifications that we do do not cast a shadow over our interior joy. We can feel very closely united to Our Lord, so that our lives may reflect once more the suffering that He underwent for our sakes. As well as experiencing great happiness in the attainment of the glory and joy of the resurrection through His passion and cross.</p>

<p>Joy has a spiritual origin, arising from a heart that loves and feels itself loved by God. Saint Paul says to the Philippians, “Rejoice in the Lord always, again I say, rejoice” (Phil. 4:4). This with a cheerfulness that is real happiness. An interior joy which cannot fail to be shown outwardly as well.</p>

<p>Saint Paul VI says it is well known that there are different degrees of this joy. Its most noble expression is the cheerfulness or happiness in its strict sense. When someone at the level of his higher faculties finds satisfaction in the possession of a good which is recognized and loved. All the more reason then that such a one should experience spiritual joy and happiness when his spirit enters into the possession of God who is known and loved as his supreme and immutable good.</p>

<p>Saint Paul VI goes on to say, “Technological society has succeeded in multiplying the occasions of pleasure, but finds great difficulty in giving birth to happiness. For happiness has its origins elsewhere, it is a spiritual thing. Money, comfort, hygiene, material security may often not be lacking, but nevertheless, despite these advantages, boredom, suffering and sadness are frequently to be found supervening in the lives of many people.”</p>

<p>Christians understand these thoughts of the Pope very well. They’re aware that joy and happiness stem from a heart that knows itself to be loved by God, and which in its turn is madly in love with Him. It will be a heart that strives to express its love in deeds. Since it knows that deeds are love, not sweet words. It knows itself to be that of a sinner, so it goes to the source of all forgiveness, to Christ in the sacrament of penance.</p>

<p>When we go to confession, we could think particularly of how the Sacred Heart of Jesus is reaching out to us. Something flowing from His heart into our heart to wash away our sins. Saint Paul says, “Lord, it is with great joy that we offer You the sacrifice that brings everlasting healing.”</p>

<p>Suffering and tribulation are inevitably the lot of everyone on this earth. Everybody needs the consolation coming from the heart of Christ. But suffering of itself alone neither transforms nor purifies. It may even be the cause of rebellion and hatred. Some Christians abandon Our Lord when they meet the cross, because they seek a purely human happiness, free from pain, and accompanied by material wealth.</p>

<p>Our soul will then be more purified, our love stronger. We will realize that joy is inseparable from the cross. It can be useful to remember that Saint Paul’s life was in no way easy or comfortable. Five times he said, “I have received at the hands of the Jews the forty lashes less one. Three times I have been beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three times I have been shipwrecked. A night and a day I have been adrift at sea. On frequent journeys, in danger from rivers, danger from robbers, danger from my own people, danger from Gentiles, danger in the city, danger in the wilderness, danger at sea, danger from false brethren. In toil and hardship, through many a sleepless night, in hunger and thirst, often without food, in cold and exposure” (2 Cor. 11:24–27).</p>

<p>Still, in spite of all this, Saint Paul speaks the truth when he tells us, “I am filled with comfort, with all our affliction I am overjoyed” (2 Cor. 7:4). Saint Josemar’a comments: “If at times we’ve been afraid of penance and atonement, we will be filled with courage at the thought of how short is the time involved, and how great the reward. A prize entirely disproportionate to our own little efforts. Let us cheerfully follow Jesus to Jerusalem, to Calvary, to the cross.”</p>

<p>After all, is it not true that as soon as you cease to be afraid of the cross, of what people call the cross, when you set your will to accept the will of God, then you find happiness, and all your worries, all your sufferings, physical or moral, pass away? During the Mass of this solemnity, we pray: “Father, we rejoice in the gifts of love we have received from the heart of Jesus your Son. Open our hearts to share His life, and continue to bless us with His love.”</p>

<p>We can draw from these moments of prayer the immense joy of considering once again the deep love that Jesus has at this moment for each one of us. A God with a heart of flesh like ours. Jesus of Nazareth still goes about the streets and squares of our cities doing good, just as when He was clothed in mortal flesh among men, helping, healing, consoling, forgiving, and through His sacraments conferring eternal life on us.</p>

<p>Saint Josemar’a says these are the infinite treasures of His heart, which He continues to pour out copiously upon us. Saint Paul teaches that “when He ascended on high, He led a host of captives, and He gave gifts to men” (Eph. 4:8). Every day we receive immeasurable graces, inspirations, and all types of material and spiritual help from the loving heart of Jesus.</p>

<p>However, He does not lord it over us. He begs us to give Him a little love, as He silently shows us His wounds. There may have been times when we have refused Him that love. Maybe often He has hoped that we would show more love, greater fervor, as we make that visit to the Blessed Sacrament or receive Holy Communion.</p>

<p>We need to make a great deal of reparation and atonement to the most Sacred Heart of Jesus for our past life, for so much wasted time, for so much roughness in the way we have dealt with Him, for so much lack of love.</p>

<p>We can say to Him in the words written by Saint Bernard: “I beg you to receive the offering of the years remaining to me. Do not despise, O my God, this heart which is contrite and humble because of all the years that I’ve spent so foolishly. Give me, Lord, the gift of contrition, despite being so clumsy in the way I talk to you and show my love for you. Increase my aversion for my deliberate venial sin. Teach me to offer you in expiation all the physical and moral setbacks of each day, my tiredness at work, and my efforts to finish off my daily tasks the way you would like me to.”</p>

<p>When we see so many people who seem set on fleeing from grace, we can’t remain indifferent. Don’t be content, says Saint Josemar’a, in the way you ask Jesus for pardon for just your own faults. Don’t love Him with your heart alone. Console Him for every offense that has been, that is, or that will be done Him. Love Him with all the strength of all the hearts of all those who have most loved Him. Be daring, telling Him that you are crazier about Him than Mary Magdalene, and either of his two Teresas. That you love Him madly, more than Augustine and Dominic and Francis, more than Ignatius and Xavier.</p>

<p>As always, we go to Jesus through the Immaculate Heart of Mary, asking her to take us little children by the hand, to lead that life of atonement and companionship with Jesus.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice. My immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

Conor Donnelly</p>

<p>(<em>Proofread</em>)</p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>“‘How can you sleep?’ he asked. ‘Rise up and pray, so that you may not enter into temptation’” (Luke 22:46).</p>

<p>There are many passages in the Gospel speaking about how Our Lord had withdrawn from the crowds and gone on His own to pray (Matt. 14:23; Mark 1:35; Luke 5:16, etc.).</p>

<p>And that’s more clearly thrown into relief at the more important moments of His public ministry: at His Baptism (Luke 3:21-22); at the election of the apostles (Luke 6:12-15); on the occasion of the first multiplication of the loaves (Mark 6:46); at the Transfiguration (Luke 9:28-29). It was a normal thing for Jesus to do.</p>

<p>St. Josemaría says, “At times he spent the whole night in an intimate conversation with his Father. The apostles were filled with love when they saw Christ pray” (Josemaría Escrivá, <em>Christ Is Passing By</em>, Point 119).</p>

<p>Before giving Himself in the Passion, Our Lord makes for the Garden of Gethsemane with His apostles. Our Lord must often have prayed there, because, St. Luke says, “Now he went out, as his custom was, to Mount Olivet (Luke 22:39).</p>

<p>But this time His prayer would be special because the moment of His agony had arrived.</p>

<p>When He comes to Gethsemane, He says to them: “Pray that you may not enter into temptation” (Luke 22:40). Before withdrawing a little to pray, Our Lord asked the Apostles too to pray.</p>

<p>He knows that they soon would be subjected to the temptation of scandal on seeing the Master taken captive. He had already announced it at the Last Supper; but now He warns them that unless they’re found vigilant and praying, they will not pass the test.</p>

<p>Prayer is indispensable for us, for if we neglect our dealings with God, little by little our spiritual life begins to languish.</p>

<p>In the <em>Furrow</em> we’re told, “If you abandon prayer you may at first live on spiritual reserves…and after that, by cheating” (J. Escrivá, <em>Furrow</em>, Point 445).</p>

<p>Bishop Sheen likes to say, “No one ever fell away from God without neglecting their prayer” (Fulton J. Sheen, <em>Characters of the Passion: Lessons on Faith and Trust</em>).</p>

<p>On the other hand, prayer unites us to God. He tells us, “Without me, you can do nothing” (John 15:5).</p>

<p>It is good, said St. Luke, to pray with perseverance, never vacillating (<em>cf</em>. Luke 18:1).</p>

<p>We have to speak with Him a great deal, insistently, in the various circumstances of our lives.</p>

<p>Now, moreover, we walk with Jesus along the Way of the Cross. In <em>The Way,</em> Point 89, we’re told, “without prayer, how difficult it is to accompany him.”</p>

<p>With the example of His own life, the Lord teaches us what our fundamental approach has to be: a continuous filial dialogue with God.</p>

<p>St. Teresa of Ávila has said, “In my view, mental prayer is nothing more but friendly dialogue and frequent solitary conversation with him whom we know loves us” (Teresa of Ávila, <em>Life</em>).</p>

<p>We have to try always to be in the presence of God and to contemplate the mysteries of our faith. This dialogue with God should not be interrupted, and even further, should be carried out in the midst of all our activities.</p>

<p>There are certain periods of the liturgical year when it should be even more intense; in a period of the day, even more intense, during mental prayer: we meditate, we speak in His presence, knowing that He truly sees us and hears us—“that you see me, that you hear me” (<em>Prayer Before Meditation</em>).</p>

<p>The need for prayer, together with the importance of charity, is one of the points most stressed by Our Lord in His public ministry.</p>

<p>“Then he parted from them, and going a stone’s throw-off, he knelt down to pray. ‘Father,’ he said, ‘if it pleases you, take this chalice from before me; only as your will is, not as mine is’” (Luke 22:41-42).</p>

<p>When His spiritual suffering was so intense that it led Him to agony, Our Lord turns to His Father with a prayer brimming with confidence.</p>

<p>He calls Him <em>Abba</em>, “Father,” and says intimate things to Him (Mark 14:36). This is the way that we also should adopt.</p>

<p>In our lives there will be moments of spiritual peace and others of more intense struggle, some moments perhaps of darkness and others of profound sorrow, with temptations to discouragement.</p>

<p>But the sight of Jesus in the Garden always points to the way that we have to proceed—with a persevering and confident prayer.</p>

<p>To move along the road to holiness, but especially when we feel the weight of our weaknesses, we have to recollect ourselves in prayer, in an intimate conversation with Our Lord.</p>

<p>Public prayer, or prayer in common, in which all the faithful take part, is holy and necessary, for God wishes also to see His children praying together (<em>cf</em>. Matt. 18:19-20).</p>

<p>But Our Lord’s commandment to us to “go into your inner room and shut the door upon yourself, and so pray to your Father in secret” (Matt. 6:6) should never be superseded.</p>

<p>The document on the liturgy of the Second Vatican Council, <em>Sacrosanctum Concilium</em>, says the liturgy is public prayer par excellence: “it is the summit toward which the activity of the Church is directed; it is also the fount from which all her power flows. …</p>

<p>“The spiritual life, however, is not limited solely to participation in the liturgy. The Christian indeed is called to pray with others, but he must also enter into their chamber to pray to the Father in secret (<em>cf</em>. Matt. 6:6); furthermore, according to St. Paul, they must ‘pray without ceasing’” (<em>cf</em>. 1 Thess. 5:17).</p>

<p>Prayer in company with other Christians ought also to be personal prayer; while the lips recite it at the proper pace and pauses, the mind gives it all her attention.</p>

<p>In prayer one speaks with God just as one converses with a friend—knowing that He is present, always attentive to what we are saying, listening to us, and replying. It is in such intimate conversation as the one that we are just now trying to have with God.</p>

<p>In these meditations we’re not just listening to a priest speaking. Hopefully we’re taking His words, making them our own, and directing them in a very personal way to Christ, to Jesus.</p>

<p>A priest doesn’t do your prayer for you. It’s your own raising up of the mind and heart to God. We have to try and work at our prayer to improve it all the time.</p>

<p>In that prayer, we throw our soul open to the Lord, to adore Him, to give Him thanks, to ask Him for help, and to go more deeply—as the apostles did—into the divine teachings. “Did not our hearts burn within us as he opened the Scriptures to us as we walked along the way?” (Luke 24:32).</p>

<p>As Our Lord opens the Scriptures to us and shows us new lights in the Scriptures, or in this event, or that event, or in our family, or in our work, hopefully we will continue to see new lights, new beginnings, that will draw us on into a deeper prayer and become more and more convinced of the importance and of the value of this activity.</p>

<p>In <em>The Way</em>, Point 91, we’re told, “You write: ‘To pray is to talk with God. But about what?’ About him, about yourself: joys, sorrows, successes and failures, noble ambitions, daily worries, weaknesses! And acts of thanksgiving and petitions, and Love and reparation. In a word, it’s worth getting to know him and to get to know yourself: ‘to get acquainted!’” (J. Escrivá, <em>The Way</em>, Point 91).</p>

<p>We could ask Our Lord for that grace to yearn to spend time with Him in prayer, and to thank Him for the grace that He has given to us in the past, maybe, years or decades of our life, where He has given us the grace of prayer.</p>

<p>Millions of people in the world have not been given that grace, and so it’s a talent we have to try and use well.</p>

<p>Our prayer ought never to be impersonal, anonymous, dispersed and lost in the crowd; because God, who has redeemed each individual person, wants to maintain a dialogue with each one: at the end of one’s life, salvation or condemnation will depend on the personal response of each one.</p>

<p>Prayer ought to be the dialogue of a particular person—one who has ideals, a specific job, specific friends, who has received specific graces from God, and wants to talk with his God about all of these things.</p>

<p>“When he rose from prayer, he went back to his disciples and found they were sleeping for sorrow.” Our Lord said, “‘How can you sleep? Rise up and pray, so that you may not enter into temptation’” (Luke 22:45-46).</p>

<p>The apostles had ignored Our Lord’s command. There may be many times in our life when we have been like the apostles. Possibly Our Lord has told us specific things, or things He wants us to do, or jobs to fulfill, or people to speak to.</p>

<p>Like the apostles, we’ve ignored His command. He may have told us those things through people, through places, through events, through spiritual direction, through means of formation, but somehow the penny didn’t drop; the message didn’t penetrate.</p>

<p>Our Lord had left them there, close to Himself, so that they would watch and pray, and so not fall into temptation.</p>

<p>But they’d been negligent. Even now, they don’t love Him enough and they allow themselves to be overcome by sleep and weakness, leaving Our Lord unaccompanied, alone, during that time of His agony.</p>

<p>If we ever find we’re overcome with the temptation to sleep, to get drowsy during our prayer, we could try and learn from this situation of the apostles.</p>

<p>We see, ‘What can I do to stay more awake? Can I kneel down, can I walk around the place? Can I do my mental prayer walking around? Do I need some sort of book, so I can look at certain topics or lines from time to time?’</p>

<p>In mental prayer, the focus is on talking with Our Lord. We glance at a line or two to help that conversation. In spiritual reading, our reading is continual reading, but in mental prayer, the reading of a few points is meant to facilitate our prayer.</p>

<p>Sleep, which is like the epitome of human weakness, has allowed an evil sadness to take hold of them: lack of spiritual struggle, abandonment of a life of piety.</p>

<p>There are lessons there for us about the importance of what the <em>Catechism of the Catholic Church</em> calls “the battle for prayer” (<em>Catechism</em>, Point 2725).</p>

<p>Occasionally in our life, we may all experience the battle for prayer. We shouldn’t expect that we can drift into our prayer as on a cloud every time we go to do our mental prayer.</p>

<p>Sometimes we might have to drag ourselves to pray. Or we might feel that our prayer is a comedy show, or we’re getting nothing out of it.</p>

<p>But St. Josemaría is very encouraging about those moments. He says, “Persevere in that prayer” (J. Escrivá, <em>The Way</em>, Point 101).</p>

<p>That prayer might be the best prayer you ever did because that prayer is all done for God and there are no human compensations.</p>

<p>If we maintain a living dialogue with God during each period of prayer, we will avoid getting into the situation of the apostles.</p>

<p>We will frequently resort to the Gospels or some other book that helps us to pray so that it can help us to channel our dialogue, to come closer to Our Lord, for whom no one or nothing can be a substitute. This is the way many saints have been made.</p>

<p>“During all those years,” says St. Teresa of Ávila, ‘except for after Communicating, I never dared begin to pray without a book; my soul was as much afraid to engage in prayer without one, as if it were having to go and fight against a host of enemies. With this help, which was a companion to me and a shield with which I could fight off the many blows of my many thoughts, I felt comforted” (Teresa of Ávila, <em>Life</em>).</p>

<p>It is really encouraging to know how the saints had to fight that battle for prayer.</p>

<p>We have to try and use all the means at our disposal to do our mental prayer in a recollected way. We should do it in the best place, according to our circumstances; and, whenever possible, in front of Our Lord in the tabernacle.</p>

<p>It should be done at the time we have already planned in our schedule for the normal day.</p>

<p>In the prayer we will always be on our guard against distractions. To a large extent, this can mean mortifying our memory and the imagination, keeping distant whatever may impede our attentiveness to God.</p>

<p>We have to avoid having “our senses awake and our soul asleep” (J. Escrivá, <em>The Way</em>, Point 368).</p>

<p>If we fight earnestly against temptations, Our Lord will make it easy for us to take up again the threads of our dialogue with Him. Our guardian angel too has the task of interceding on our behalf.</p>

<p>What’s important is that we do not want to be distracted, or that we have no intention of being willingly distracted during our time of prayer.</p>

<p>Involuntary distractions which may come about in spite of ourselves, and which we try to reject as soon as we’re aware of them, do not lessen the merit or the benefit of prayer. A father or a mother doesn’t get annoyed if the baby keeps uttering meaningless noises because it doesn’t yet know how to speak.</p>

<p>God knows our weaknesses and is patient, but we have to ask Him: Lord, “grant me the spirit of prayer” (Divine Office, <em>Lauds–Monday of Fourth Week of Lent</em>).</p>

<p>It pleases Our Lord when we resolve to improve our mental prayer each day of our lives—even on those occasions when things require more effort, are difficult, or when we feel arid.</p>

<p>“Prayer is not a question of what you say or feel, but of love. And you love when you try to say something to the Lord, even though you might not actually say anything” (J. Escrivá, <em>Furrow</em>, Point 464).</p>

<p>If this is our approach, then our life will be continually enriched and strengthened.</p>

<p>Every person can only truly know themselves with the light of God.</p>

<p>“All that we can know of ourselves through human means (life experiences, psychology, social sciences) are not to be denigrated…But those things give us a limited and partial knowledge of our being.</p>

<p>“We only have access to our profound identity through the light of God, in the regard that God has on us as the Father in heaven.</p>

<p>“This knowledge has a negative aspect, but it is one that leads to something positive. The negative aspect concerns our sin, our profound misery. We don’t recognize it except in the light of God.</p>

<p>“Faced with him, lies are no longer possible; there’s no escaping, no justification, no more masks to cling to. We’re obliged to recognize who we are, with our wounds, our weaknesses, our inconsistencies, our egoism, our hardness of heart, our secret complicities with evil.</p>

<p>“Happily, God is tender and merciful, and this light that is shed on us is done so progressively, as we are able to handle it. God only shows us our sin while simultaneously revealing his forgiveness and his mercy. We discover the sadness of our sinful condition, and also our absolute poverty as creatures” (Jacques Philippe, <em>Nine Days to Rediscover the Joy of Prayer</em>).</p>

<p>All this happens in our prayer. “This step toward truth is necessary: there is no healing without knowledge of the sickness. Only the truth makes us free.</p>

<p>“Fortunately, things don’t stop there. They lead on to something still more profound and infinitely beautiful: beyond our sins and our misery, the discovery of our condition as children of God. God loves us just as we are, with an absolutely unconditional love, and it’s this love that forms our deepest identity.</p>

<p>“More deep and essential than our human limits and the evil that affects us, there is at our base an intact and pure core, our identity as sons and daughters of God” (<em>ibid</em>.).</p>

<p>Prayer is a powerful lamp which throws light on our problems, enables us to get to know people better, and thus to help them on their path towards Christ, and to assign the proper place to the matters which preoccupy us.</p>

<p>Our prayer helps God to be the center of our lives. The more He’s there, the more we’re expecting everything from Him and from Him only, and the more our human relationships will have the chance to be well-adapted and happy.</p>

<p>“Experience shows us that faithfulness to prayer, even if it sometimes goes through difficult periods, moments of dryness, or trying times, progressively leads us to find in God a profound peace, a security, a happiness that makes us free with regard to others and to things” (<em>ibid</em>.).</p>

<p>Prayer locates the soul in an environment of serenity and of peace, which is then transmitted to others. The joy it produces is a foretaste of the happiness in heaven.</p>

<p>No one on this earth has known how to treat Jesus better than His Mother Mary, who spent long hours looking at Him, speaking with Him, handling Him with simplicity and veneration.</p>

<p>If we turn to Our Mother in heaven, we will learn quite quickly to follow Jesus confidently and to speak with Him very closely.</p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>This feast celebrates the fact that St. Peter established his See in Rome. Christians were known to have celebrated this feast before the fourth century. The original name found on the ancient calendars was <em>Natale Petri de Cathedra</em>, which means the Birth of the Seat of Peter.</p>

<p>Our Lord said to Simon Peter, “I have prayed…that your faith may not fail, and…you in your turn must strengthen your brothers” (Luke 22:32).</p>

<p>The Chair of St. Peter refers to his seat of authority. The Fathers of the Church use this term as a symbol of a bishop’s authority, paying special regard to the Bishop of Rome.</p>

<p>In the third century, St. Cyprian wrote: “Peter holds primacy so as to show that Christ’s Church is one and that his Chair is one.” He goes on to emphasize the matter of unity when he says, “God is one. The Lord is one. The Church is one. The Chair founded by Christ is one” (Cyprian, <em>Epistle 43</em>).</p>

<p>For many years, the people of Rome had on display a wooden chair which St. Peter reputedly had sat upon. Pope St. Damasus moved this relic to the baptistery of the newly built Vatican in the fourth century.</p>

<p>The chair was seen and honored by thousands of pilgrims from all over the Christian world. At the time when the present Basilica of St. Peter was erected, it was thought advisable to preserve the chair in bronze and gold.</p>

<p>Before the fourth century, in the earliest liturgical calendars of the Church, one finds this feast, the Birth of the Seat of Peter. It is a celebration of the institution of the papacy.</p>

<p>This feast highlights the fact that the Bishop of Rome has jurisdiction throughout the entire world. It has been a long-standing custom to commemorate the consecration of bishops in their respective dioceses. Yet these commemorations pertain solely to the limits of each diocese. The Chair of Peter, however, is unique in that it extends to all Christianity and has done so from the first centuries.</p>

<p>St. Augustine says, “Our forefathers gave the name ‘Chair’ to this feast so that we might remember that the Prince of the Apostles was entrusted with the ‘Chair’ of the episcopate” (Augustine, <em>Sermon 15 on the Saints</em>). We can think on this feast day today about our love and our obedience to the Holy Father.</p>

<p>We know from the tradition of the Church, particularly from St. Leo the Great (<em>cf</em>. Leo I, <em>Homily 82 on the Feast of the Apostles Peter and Paul</em>), that St. Peter lived for a period of time in the city of Antioch, where the disciples, as we are told in the Acts, “were first called Christians” (Acts 11:26).</p>

<p>There he preached the Good News and then returned to Jerusalem, where a bloody persecution had broken out.</p>

<p>“At this time Herod the king set hands on certain members of the Church to persecute them. He killed James, the brother of John, with the sword, and seeing that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also, during the days of the Unleavened Bread,” as we are told in the Acts (Acts 12:3).</p>

<p>Freed from prison by the intercession of an angel, Peter left Palestine and “went to another place” (Acts 12:17). The <em>Acts of the Apostles</em> doers not state specifically where Peter went, but tradition tells us that he began to make his way to the Eternal City.</p>

<p>St. Jerome claims that Peter arrived in Rome during the second year of the reign of Claudius, about 43 A.D., and remained there for twenty-five years until his death (Jerome, <em>De Viris Illustribus</em>).</p>

<p>Other authors believe that Peter made two trips to Rome: one immediately following his captivity in Jerusalem, and having gone to Palestine on the occasion of the Council of Jerusalem in 49 AD, he returned to Rome. Later he carried out other missionary journeys.</p>

<p>St. Peter arrived at this, the capital of the world, “to better spread the light of the truth from the head to the rest of the body,” said St. Leo the Great.</p>

<p>“What race was not represented in this city? What peoples would ignore what Rome said? This was the proper place to refute false philosophies, to challenge the foolishness of purely human reasoning, to destroy the empty sacrifices of the cults. For it was to Rome that all the different errors had come together” (Leo I, <em>loc. cit</em>.)</p>

<p>The fisherman from Galilee became the rock and the foundation of the Church. He chose to establish this foundation in the Eternal City. Here he preached the Good News as he had done in Judea, in Samaria, in Galilee, and in Antioch.</p>

<p>From his Chair in Rome, Peter governed the whole Church. It was there in Rome that Peter gave up his own life for the faith in imitation of the Master.</p>

<p>The tomb of the Prince of the Apostles lies directly beneath the main altar of St. Peter’s Basilica. This has been the constant tradition and it has recently been confirmed by archaeological investigation. The tomb serves as an enduring symbol that Simon Peter is by divine election the Church’s firm foundation. The voice of our Savior can be heard down through the centuries in the teachings of the Roman Pontiffs.</p>

<p>Today’s Gospel reminds us of the immortal promise made by Jesus to Peter and all of his successors as Pope: “I say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven” (Matt. 16:18-19).</p>

<p>I was in St. Peter’s for the inauguration of the pontificate of Pope John Paul II. There was a moment in that ceremony when all the, I think, a hundred-plus cardinals filed up to promise their obedience to the Pope.</p>

<p>During that time, the choir was singing these words: <em>Tu es Petrus, et super hanc petram aedificabo Ecclesiam meam</em>. “You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my Church.”</p>

<p>That part of the ceremony took about half an hour, so we heard these words over and over again. It was very moving, very beautiful, very impressive. When you hear those words repeated so many times, it leaves a mark. That’s all that I remember of that particular occasion.</p>

<p>When his successor, Pope Benedict, was elected, he decided to change that part of the ceremony. Instead of having a hundred cardinals, he had one cardinal, one bishop, one priest, and one married couple representing the whole of the Church. It was finished in five minutes. But it reflected the very clear teaching of the Second Vatican Council.</p>

<p>St. Augustine comments, “Blessed be God, who deigned to exalt the Apostle Peter over the whole Church. It is most fitting that this foundation be honored since it is a means by which we may ascend to heaven” (Augustine, <em>Sermon 15 on the Saints</em>).</p>

<p>Acting from Rome, Peter consoled, instructed, and strengthened the many Christian churches which were developing throughout the Roman Empire.</p>

<p>In the First Reading of today’s Mass, Peter exhorts Church leaders in Asia Minor to shepherd their flocks with charity. He says, “Tend the flock of God which is among you, governing not under constraint, but willingly, according to God; nor yet for the sake of base gain, but eagerly” (1 Pet. 5:2).</p>

<p>These words of Peter hearken back to the teaching of the Master about the Good Shepherd (John 10:1 <em>ff</em>). We may specifically recall that moving scene after the Resurrection when Jesus said to Simon Peter: “Feed my lambs. … Feed my sheep” (John 21:15-17).</p>

<p>This is the mission which Our Lord has entrusted to Peter and to each of his successors: to take good care of the Lord’s flock, to confirm the faith of the People of God; to safeguard doctrine and customs; to interpret the truths contained in divine Revelation with the help of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>St. Peter writes in his Second Epistle: “Therefore I shall begin to remind you always of these things; although indeed you know them and are well established in the present truth. As long as I am in this tabernacle, I think it right to arouse you by a reminder, knowing as I do that the putting off of my tabernacle is at hand, just as Our Lord Jesus Christ signified to me. Moreover, I will endeavor that after my death you may have occasion to call these things to mind” (2 Pet. 1:12-15).</p>

<p>Today’s feast gives us a good opportunity to deepen our filial devotion to the Holy Father and to his teachings. We should remember the quality of our personal commitment to know his teachings and to put them into practice.</p>

<p>Love for the Pope is a good indicator of our love for Christ. This love and veneration needs to be specified in daily prayer and sacrifice for his intentions.</p>

<p>“May the Lord preserve him and give him life and make him blessed on earth and not deliver him up to the will of his enemies” (<em>Enchiridion Indulgentiarum</em>, prayer <em>pro Pontifice</em>).</p>

<p>We should show this love in real life: whenever we make a trip for apostolic purposes, when we are sick, whenever people are attacking the Church, when we are introducing our friends to the faith.</p>

<p>St. Josemaría in <em>The Way</em> says, “Catholic, apostolic, Roman! I want you to be very Roman, ever anxious to make your ‘pilgrimage’ to Rome, <em>videre Petrum</em>—to see Peter” (Josemaría Escrivá, <em>The Way</em>, Point 520).</p>

<p>There are a number of passages in Scripture that remind us of our love for the Pope and of our unity to the Holy Father.</p>

<p>We’re told in St. Peter: “You had gone astray like sheep but now you have returned to the shepherd and guardian of your souls” (1 Pet. 2:25).</p>

<p>In St. John, Our Lord says, “I am the gate. Anyone who enters through me will be safe. Such a one will go in and out and will find pasture. The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I have come so that they may have life and have it to the full” (John 10:9-10).</p>

<p>“And there are other sheep I have that are not of this fold, and I must lead these too. They too will listen to my voice, and there will be one flock, one shepherd” (John 10:16).</p>

<p>In St. Luke, He says, “But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail, and once you have recovered, you in your turn must strengthen your brothers” (Luke 22:32).</p>

<p>And again in St. John, “The Father, for what he has given me, is greater than anyone, and no one can steal anything from the Father’s hand” (John 10:29).</p>

<p>“When the chief shepherd appears, you will be given the unfading crown of glory” (1 Pet. 5:4).</p>

<p>“When they had eaten, Jesus said to Simon Peter, ‘Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these do?’ He answered, ‘Yes, Lord, you know I love you.’ Jesus said to him, ‘Feed my lambs’” (John 21:15).</p>

<p>“I am the vine, you are the branches. Whoever remains in me, with me in him, bears fruit in plenty; for cut off from me you can do nothing” (John 15:5).</p>

<p>“Around the time that those words were spoken, Herod the king started persecuting certain members of the Church. He had James, the brother of John, beheaded. When he saw this pleased the Jews, he went on to arrest Peter as well. As it was during the days of Unleavened Bread that he had arrested him, he put him in prison, assigning four sections of four soldiers each to guard him, meaning to try him in public after the Passover. All the time Peter was under guard, the Church prayed to God for him unremittingly.</p>

<p>“On the night before Herod was to try him, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, fastened with two chains, while guards kept watch at the main entrance to the prison. Then suddenly an angel of the Lord stood there, and the cell was filled with light.</p>

<p>“The angel tapped Peter on the side and woke him. ‘Get up!’ he said, ‘Hurry!’ The chains fell from his hands. The angel then said, ‘Put on your belt and sandals.’ After he had done this, the angel next said, ‘Wrap your cloak around you and follow me.’</p>

<p>“He followed him out, but had no idea what the angel did was all happening in reality; he thought he was seeing a vision. They passed through the first guard post and the second, and reached the iron gate leading to the city. This opened of its own accord. They went through it and had walked the whole length of one street when suddenly the angel left him.</p>

<p>“It was only then that Peter came to himself, and he said, ‘Now I know it is all true. The Lord really did send his angel and save me from Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting.’ As soon as he realized this, he went straight to the house of Mary, the mother of John Mark, where a number of people had assembled and were praying” (Acts 12:1-12).</p>

<p>In the <em>Communion Antiphon</em> of the Mass, we’re told, “The Good Shepherd is risen. He who laid down his life for his sheep, who died for his flock, he is risen, Alleluia.”</p>

<p>Our Lord, the Good Shepherd, entrusts Peter and his successors with the government of the Church to continue His mission on earth. The sacrifice of the Shepherd gave life to His sheep and brought them back to the fold.</p>

<p>Years later, St. Peter confirmed Christians in their faith by reminding them, in the midst of persecution, what Christ had done and suffered for them. He wrote, “By his wounds you have been healed. For you were straying like sheep, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls” (1 Pet. 2:24-25).</p>

<p>The whole Church prays that “the continuing work of the Redeemer will bring us eternal joy” (<em>Prayer over the Offerings</em>), and asks God the Father to “give us new strength from the courage of Christ our Shepherd, and lead us to join the saints in heaven” (<em>Collect</em>).</p>

<p>The early Christians had a special affection for the image of the Good Shepherd and left countless testimonies of it in the catacombs and on many well-known ancient buildings through murals, reliefs, gravestone etchings, mosaics, and sculptures.</p>

<p>We are invited to contemplate our Savior’s merciful tenderness so that we may recognize the rights He acquired over each one of us by His death. It’s also good in our prayer to consider our love for the good shepherds whom He has left to guide us and keep us in His name.</p>

<p>Every day we should pray for the Holy Father and remind our children to pray for the Holy Father, and educate them little by little on who the Pope is and how much he needs our support and our affection.</p>

<p>When I was about six or seven, my father made me send a Christmas card to the Pope. I had to make it myself. He got a few sheets of hard paper, and then I had to draw an Irish mountain, and one line up and one line down—I had no artistic talents—and then a little cottage, and smoke coming out of the cottage on the hillside. The mountain had to be painted gray, and the cottage had to be painted white, and the smoke had to be gray, and the fields had to be green. Then I made a mistake, and I had to do the whole thing over again. I couldn’t wait to be finished; I didn’t know what all this was about.</p>

<p>Then it was sent off to Rome. There’s a policy in St. Peter’s that they always reply to every letter that they get. So a few months later, a card came back.</p>

<p>The first line said, “The Secretariat of State of His Holiness.” I didn’t know what that meant. But that card had to be framed and put on the wall. It took me a couple of years before I could get to the second and third line to understand the big words.</p>

<p>But when I came in contact with Opus Dei, then I realized what it was my father was trying to teach me ten years previously: to have a love for the Holy Father.</p>

<p>The Old Testament frequently refers to the Messiah as a Good Shepherd who must feed, rule, and govern God’s people who were often abandoned and scattered. The prophecies of the awaited Shepherd are fulfilled in Jesus, but in Him with new features.</p>

<p>He is the Good Shepherd who gives life for His sheep and who provides other shepherds to continue His mission. As opposed to thieves who seek their own interests and destroy the flock, Jesus is the door of salvation; he who enters will find abundant pasture (<em>cf</em>. John. 10:9).</p>

<p>There is a tender relationship between Jesus the Good Shepherd and His sheep. He calls each by his name. He leads them. The sheep follow because they know His voice. He is the one and only Shepherd who has only “one flock” (<em>cf</em>. John 10:16), protected by the Father’s love (<em>cf</em>. John 10:29), and He is “the chief Shepherd” (1 Pet. 5:4).</p>

<p>In His last appearance before the Ascension, the risen Christ made Peter the shepherd of His flock. In this way the prophecy made to Peter before the Passion was fulfilled: “But I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail; and when you have turned again, strengthen your brethren” (Luke 22:32). Then He prophesied that as a good shepherd, He would die for His flock.</p>

<p>Our Lord trusts Peter in spite of the denials. He simply asks for His love the same number of times that He had been denied. Our Lord doesn’t mind entrusting His Church to a weak man who repents and loves with deeds.</p>

<p>“Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, ‘Do you love me?’ and he said to him, ‘Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you.’ Jesus said to him, ‘Feed my sheep’” (John 21:17). The shepherd symbol which Jesus claimed for Himself is passed on to Peter. He must continue Our Lord’s mission and be His representative on earth.</p>

<p>Our Lord’s words to Peter—“Feed my lambs, feed my sheep”—explain Peter’s mission as one of guarding Our Lord’s flock without limitations. The word and verb ‘feed’ is equivalent to ‘direct and govern.’ That is what Peter is entrusted with.</p>

<p>Peter is made the shepherd and the guide for the whole Church. The Second Vatican Council wrote, “Jesus Christ put Peter at the head of the other apostles, and in him he set up a lasting and visible source and foundation of the unity of both faith and communion” (Vatican II, <em>Lumen gentium</em>, Point 18, November 21, 1964).</p>

<p>There’s a saying in Latin that says: <em>Ubi Petrus ibi Ecclesia</em>-where Peter is, there is Christ’s Church. In union with him, we know with certainty the way that leads to salvation.</p>

<p>The Church is built on the primacy of Peter, as on a rock, until the end of the world. Peter’s stature is immeasurably enhanced since Christ is the real foundation of the Church (1 Cor. 3:11), and Peter now takes His place. That’s why his successors have since acquired the title of Vicar of Christ, that is, one who takes the place of Christ.</p>

<p>Peter is the Church’s strong defense against the storms she has suffered and will suffer throughout the centuries. Built on him, as foundation and with his watchfulness as good shepherd, its victory is assured despite trials and temptations.</p>

<p>Peter must eventually die, but as regards his role of supreme shepherd, the First Vatican Council said, “Our Lord will assure it lasts eternally for the perpetual health and perennial good of the Church, which, being founded on rock, must remain stable to the end of time” (Vatican I, <em>Pastor aeternus</em>, Chapter 2, July 18, 1870).</p>

<p>Love for the Pope goes back to the Church’s beginnings. The <em>Acts of the Apostles</em> tell us movingly of the early Christians’ reaction to the imprisonment of St. Peter by Herod Agrippa, who planned to kill him when the Paschal feast was over. Meanwhile, the Church prayed unceasingly to God for him (<em>cf</em>. Acts 12:1-12).</p>

<p>“Look at how the faithful feel for their pastors,” says St. John Chrysostom. They don’t resort to protest or rebellion, but to prayer as an unfailing remedy. They did not say: as we are powerless men, it is useless to pray for him. They never reasoned in this way, but they prayed with love” (John Chrysostom, <em>Homilies on the Acts of the Apostles</em>).</p>

<p>We ought to pray a lot for the Pope and his intentions since he bears the heavy weight of the Church on his shoulders. Every day the clamor of the entire Church, spread over the world, rises to God in petition for him and with him. No Mass is celebrated without his name being mentioned, and prayers are said for him and his intentions.</p>

<p>Our Lord will be very pleased to see that throughout the day we remember to offer our prayers, our hours of work or study, or some mortifications, for His Vicar on earth.</p>

<p>St. Josemaría said in <em>The Way</em>, “Thank you, my God, for that love for the Pope that you have placed in my heart” (J. Escrivá, <em>The Way</em>, Point 573).</p>

<p>It would be wonderful if we could say this prayer more meaningfully every day. Love and veneration for the Roman Pontiff is one of the great gifts Our Lord has left us.</p>

<p>We can turn to Our Lady, Mother of the Church, and ask her in a special way to look after our Holy Father, protect him and guide him and enlighten him. May he be a symbol of unity for the whole world.</p>

<p>Help us, Mary, in the course of our life, to feel a greater responsibility to pray more and to be more united to the Holy Father as we progress in our life.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

Conor Donnelly</p>

<p>(<em>Proofread</em>)</p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>“Be you perfect, therefore, as also your heavenly Father is perfect” (Matt. 5:48).</p>

<p>By virtue of Baptism, the Christian carries supernatural, sanctifying grace in his soul. This is the seed, the root, of supernatural life. As every healthy seed carries within it the urge to grow and unfold, so also with the sanctifying grace within us.</p>

<p>Every baptized person comes under the law of impulse to growth and fulfillment. If a person was to try to escape this law and refuse to grow, he would necessarily wither and decline.</p>

<p>Every created life encounters disturbing forces that seek to hinder its development. And so too, there are many evil elements threatening the existence of supernatural life.</p>

<p>Anyone who is not earnestly concerned with fostering their supernatural life eventually succumbs to these disturbing forces. That’s why we must never hesitate but go on and on.</p>

<p>“The fundamental duty of every Christian is to press earnestly towards the goal of perfection, to become more perfect, moment by moment. Only in this way can we preserve our supernatural life and ensure its unfolding” (Benedict Baur, <em>In Silence With God</em>).</p>

<p>“Be perfect.” With inexpressible love the Lord has taken us up into His own life in the sacrament of Baptism, that we may “partake of his divine nature” (2 Pet. 1:4). Powerful phrase of St. Peter, that we would [be taken up into God’s own life].</p>

<p>In addition to the supernatural life principle of sanctifying grace, He has given us the three divine virtues—of faith, of hope, and of love—as well as feet to carry us to Him, arms with which to receive Him, and a plenitude of so-called moral virtues—like justice, prudence, strength, temperance—with which to circumvent the daily influence of earthly things, and in that way strengthen the gifts of the Holy Spirit, which in fact are supernatural prerequisites for a perfect, holy life.</p>

<p>Grafted to Christ, the vine (Rom. 11:17), in Baptism, we automatically become children of the Church (<em>Catechism</em>, Point 1213)—“ours, the holy, God-inspired writings of the Old and New Testament; ours, the sacraments; ours, the mystery of Christ in the blessed Eucharist as sacrifice and spiritual nourishment; ours, the rewards and virtues, the prayers and satisfactions of Christ in His holy, pure, God-loving soul in heaven and on earth” (<em>ibid</em>.)</p>

<p>In Baptism, God Himself—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—lovingly takes residence in our soul, to be near to us, to draw us into His divine life, and secretly to copy and develop it in us.</p>

<p>It is not only possible, but imperative, for us to “become perfect, as our Father in heaven is perfect.”</p>

<p>Just as Baptism is the sacrament of rebirth, so Confirmation is the sacrament of fulfillment. As at Pentecost, the Holy Spirit descended upon the apostles, so He descends upon us Christians in confirmation, bringing us the strength to bear testimony for Christ.</p>

<p>How do we do that? Primarily by leading a life “dead unto the sins of the world” (Rom. 6:11), and then by allowing the intentions and virtues of Christ to light up in us, that we may become like another Christ, ready to make every sacrifice and put forth every effort to resist all things that might be contrary to our union with God.</p>

<p>In the sacrament of Confirmation, we receive the power and strength to attain maturity and perfection in Christian life. Confirmation urges us to take the first faltering steps toward Christian fulfillment: “Be you perfect.”</p>

<p>Ever anew, we are called to assist in the sacrifice of the Mass, that we may actively participate in the offering up of Christ, uniting ourselves with Him in the offering.</p>

<p>Whenever we receive Holy Communion worthily, or assist in the sacrifice with the priest, we renew the redemption Christ earned for us on the Cross. We join in His sacrifice, making His intentions and His objects our own.</p>

<p>When Our Lord, in Holy Communion, gives Himself for our soul’s nourishment, He fills us to the depths of our being with His spirit and His sacrificial power.</p>

<p>Then we become strong to cope with our daily tasks. All our efforts and strivings can be permeated with the Christ-like spirit of surrender to the glory of God.</p>

<p>In this way, the Christian can turn their entire day into one unbroken sacrifice of prayer, thanksgiving, praise, and expiation, by beginning it with Holy Communion, offering up everything that God’s will has imposed upon us to do, to endure, or to suffer.</p>

<p>Participation in Mass gives us the daily opportunity to enter more fully into Our Lord’s spirit of sacrifice, into His surrender to the Father, into His obedience unto death.</p>

<p>Every day it renews and intensifies our need to draw from Holy Communion the courage and strength to unite ourselves in an innermost spiritual wholeness with Christ, completely absorbed in His will, so that we may offer ourselves totally with Him and fulfill the command: “Be you perfect.”</p>

<p>In the first place, this means fulfilling God’s will. Who is it that submits to every demand for the honor of God; who surrenders themselves completely, without reserve, to the guidance and providence of God, than the person who is perfect?</p>

<p>One perfect soul glorifies God more than thousands of imperfect souls, because a single act of love on the part of a perfect soul is more pleasing to God than the sum total of all the incomplete acts of love offered by those who have not reached perfection.</p>

<p>But the perfect soul is constantly occupied in such acts of perfect love.</p>

<p>And so, if we wish truly and eagerly to worship Our Lord, our constant aim should be to rise above our shortcomings and reach perfection.</p>

<p>In the second place, “Be you perfect” means the well-being of our soul. The more we occupy ourselves with the attainment of perfection, the more surely we will guard ourselves against sin, against every sin, however unimportant it might seem.</p>

<p>The person who wrestles for perfection withstands the many opportunities and temptations that lead to evil. That person never loses sight of the ideal spurring him on, leaving him no peace. He has no time for half-measures.</p>

<p>“Be you perfect.” We need saints in these times. St. Josemaría and many people who came after him—Pope Benedict, Pope John Paul II—have talked about “these times are times for saints” (<em>cf</em>. Josemaría Escrivá, <em>The Way</em>, Point 301).</p>

<p>Sometimes we hear that conditions in the world today are hopeless, that we can’t go on. What can save the world today? Pope Francis has also emphasized that only the holiness of Christians can do so (<em>cf</em>. Apostolic Exhortation, <em>Gaudete et exsultate</em>, Point 6, March 19, 2018).</p>

<p>We need perfect Christians, perfect priests and nuns, perfect fathers and mothers, perfect students, officials, workers, and employers.</p>

<p>If anyone wishes to render a true service to the world, to the Church, to his country, to mankind, to himself, he must start with himself by subordinating everything to the pursuit and attainment of perfection.</p>

<p>There was a piece of news recently about a religious order in New York, I think called the Daughters of Charity (Sisters of Charity of New York), who have decided not to receive any more vocations and are sort of closing down. They feel they’ve reached the end of their mission after 150 years.</p>

<p>Pope St. John Paul II said this will happen to many religious orders. Many people who are there are elderly. But then in the next paragraph that announced this, they said that in the last 150 years, this religious order had started 160 schools, twenty-eight hospitals, a college of liberal arts, and quite a number of other things.</p>

<p>Sort of pause for a moment. Hundred and something schools, twenty-eight hospitals! One religious order did that over 150 years!</p>

<p>The history of some of these religious orders is truly incredible. What people have achieved with their lives!</p>

<p>And if you asked any one of those people involved in those organizations, I don’t think they’d tell you, ‘We were just here to build schools and to start hospitals.’</p>

<p>You’ll find this commitment to holiness and perfection was at the basis of all their endeavors. Over time, this yields this abundant fruit.</p>

<p>We have an awful lot to be proud of in our Church. It’s also important that we have a good knowledge of our history, and of the great things that people of the Catholic Church have achieved in society in the past hundreds of years, so that we see what <em>we</em> have to achieve in the 21st and 22nd centuries.</p>

<p>We might find ourselves surrounded today by a very unchristian world, a very worldly spirit in many places, in hearts, and in minds. We might think the world has never been in such a bad state.</p>

<p>But if you get to know a little bit more about history, you’ll find the opposite is the truth. The times we live in are no better or no worse than many other eras.</p>

<p>We might find the world is in a bit of a mess, in spite of all the effort on the part of ecclesiastical authorities or religious orders, or in spite of so many good books and writings, so many missions or congresses, or sermons, or Confessions, or Communions, or pilgrimages.</p>

<p>The build-up may be magnificent; the results might seem meager and impermanent. Over and over again, the Evil One arrives to sow his weeds, and “the weeds can choke the good seed” (<em>cf</em>. Matt. 13:22).</p>

<p>But yet you look back after 150 years and you see a glowing treasure.</p>

<p>In truth there’s only one cure, one solution—the earnest striving for perfection, the full realization of living active Christian virtue—in a word, Christian holiness, and this has to have deep roots.</p>

<p>The soul of perfection is the inner life, turning from worldliness, breaking with every conscious sin and attachment to anything other than God, and to anything that can hinder our union with God.</p>

<p>We have to practice renunciation, and contrition, and atonement, taking care of our spiritual life, our prayer, our meditation, and working with the spirit of love so that we also put perfection into our work, because that’s the role of the ordinary layperson in the middle of the world: to sanctify the temporal realities, the world of work. That’s what our vocation in the middle of the world is all about.</p>

<p>That is why the present times demand of Christians a life of Christian perfection because this alone is what will change things.</p>

<p>When we love, we are perfect. “You shall love the Lord your God with your whole heart, and with your whole soul, and with your whole mind…and your neighbor as yourself” (Matt. 22:37,39).</p>

<p>Love is the highest expression, the ultimate term, of our capacity. In love, we gather up our whole being—our feelings, our will, our endeavor, our giving ourselves, with all that we possess and all that we are capable of—to the one that we love.</p>

<p>God is glorified by love more than by anything else. Love most completely fulfills His commandments.</p>

<p>We’re told in St. Matthew that on the commandments to love God and our neighbor “hang the whole law and the prophets” (Matt. 22:40).</p>

<p>All the commandments and duties refer to love. Love is the fulfillment of commandments and duties; without love, there is no fulfillment. It’s the soul of all the virtues; it is itself all virtues.</p>

<p>If love is lacking, all is lacking. “If I do not have love,” says St. Paul, “I have nothing, I am nothing” (<em>cf</em>. 1 Cor. 13:2). Where love is, there all things are, including all the other virtues.</p>

<p>These virtues grow as naturally out of love as out of their own roots: they serve love and smooth its path to such an extent that the loving soul easily and readily does everything that love demands.</p>

<p>We are just as perfect as the love that we bear. Bear to whom? To God and to our neighbor.</p>

<p>That is why God makes love the sign by which His disciples may be known. “By this will all men know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another” (John 13:35).</p>

<p>In the same way, the Apostle measures our love for God by the love that we bear toward our neighbors. In the first Letter of St. John, he says, “For he that loves not his brother…how can he love God?” (1 John 4:20).</p>

<p>The love with which we love God and our brother in Christ is the same. Only the motive differs. We love God for His own sake; our brother, through the will of God and Christ.</p>

<p>The concept of perfection, which many people entertain, may be deceptive and destructive. Perfection does not consist of extraordinary penances or fasting or the greatest possible sacrifices.</p>

<p>Some might think that we’re perfect and they’re perfect when they are free from temptation and strife, when they can pray plentifully without any trouble, when they experience comfort and sweetness in prayer, when they are able to pray just as they wish to pray.</p>

<p>Or they might think that they’re perfect if they follow the rules and regulations to the letter. Mortifications, zeal in prayer, observance of rules are indispensable for spiritual perfection, but they’re not perfection in themselves.</p>

<p>There might be many among the mortified, among the ardent worshippers, many rule-abiding people, who might be unyielding in their judgment.</p>

<p>They might be proud and vain, obstinate and opinionated, fault-finding, lacking love in thought and speech, hypersensitive, jealous, easily put out, moody and uncontrolled. These can hardly be called perfect.</p>

<p>We are just as perfect as the love we bear, when love is within reach of all who are in a state of sanctifying grace, who keep God’s commandments, who commit no mortal sin.</p>

<p>And is such a one truly perfect? Not necessarily, because perfection demands more than this. It rules out not only all mortal sin but every conscious, venial sin.</p>

<p>It declares war on every fault of which it becomes aware. It tolerates no neglect, no half-measures, no easygoing indifference, no fault of character—even though it cannot prevent man here on earth from often falling victim to unconscious weaknesses and faults of human nature.</p>

<p>Perfection consists particularly of doing all that is good that is possible in given circumstances and situations—and not only what is commanded or cannot be omitted without sinning.</p>

<p>It extends beyond the sphere of duty. It does not ask, ‘Must I do this?’ ‘Is it a sin if I do it or don’t do it?’</p>

<p>And any good we have an opportunity to perform must be complete: outwardly perfect, performed in a proper and careful manner, leaving no room for the least reproach of negligence; inwardly perfect, springing from an intention of pure love, sincerely first for the sake of God’s will and Christ’s.</p>

<p>But we are really perfect only when it has become a habit, second nature, to regulate our thoughts and actions entirely with reference to God, His will, His honor and glory, yielding in all things to His good pleasure.</p>

<p>Perfection rests upon love, that is to say, on the complete fulfillment of the commandment: “You shall love the Lord your God…with your whole soul, and with your whole mind…and your neighbor as yourself” (Matt. 22:37,39).</p>

<p>Whoever loves anything more than God, whoever loves anything opposed to God, whoever loves in the same degree anything that is not God, fails to fulfill the commandment of love and consequently is not on the road to perfection.</p>

<p>If that person wishes to take the way of a perfect life, they must in some measure fulfill the law of love.</p>

<p>Christians have a wide field of endeavor in seeking perfection, because perfection, like love, has unlimited forms.</p>

<p>We can talk about two kinds of Christian perfection: essential perfection and perfection in a narrower and more particular sense.</p>

<p>Essential perfection may be described as perfection in a wider sense—that perfection without which no one can attain the goal of Christian life: eternal life in God.</p>

<p>This requires not only the fulfillment of the commandments but, over and above that, doing everything that is necessary to remain in a state of grace.</p>

<p>If a Christian were only to do or leave undone that which he is strictly commanded by the law to do or not to do, he would still not fulfill Christ’s command, “Be you perfect.”</p>

<p>If such a person were to practice brotherly love only when it was indicated by strict duty, where it could not be withheld without sin, they would have fulfilled the law of brotherly love in only the minimum of cases.</p>

<p>A person who never goes beyond the strict letter of the law is still a long way from essential perfection.</p>

<p>Perfection in the particular and narrower sense goes far beyond essential perfection. It not only fulfills the law but seeks to carry out every recommendation, every good act suggested by God and Christ.</p>

<p>Passing beyond what is strictly commanded or forbidden, this species of perfection consists of a positive eagerness to excel in the more difficult tasks, renunciations, and sacrifices.</p>

<p>Wherever the soul may most heroically prove its love, those striving for higher perfection are to be found, performing their tasks carefully, punctually, with complete devotion, self-surrender, and endurance.</p>

<p>We’re told that Our Lady went “with haste into the hill country” (Luke 1:39). She went quickly, with enthusiasm, with initiative, with daring, with the fortitude to face the challenges, to perform that corporal act of mercy with her cousin Elizabeth; and, with great fortitude, did not tell Joseph where she was going, placing her vocation first.</p>

<p>We can ask Our Lady that we might follow in her example to lead a life of striving for that perfection that we see in her who is the model of all the virtues.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

Conor Donnelly</p>

<p><em>(Proofread)</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>“Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away” (Luke 21:33), we’re told by Our Lord in St. Luke.</p>

<p>What Jesus has said in His preaching, in His conversations, will literally last forever. God has directed those words to every man, every woman, every child who will walk the face of the earth.</p>

<p>We’re told by St. Paul in his <em>Letter to the Hebrews</em>, “In many and various ways, God spoke of old to our fathers by the prophets, but in these last days he has spoken to us by a Son…” (Heb. 1:1-2).</p>

<p>Just as He spoke to our forefathers in the faith, Our Lord speaks to us in our day. Because His message is divine, it can’t be limited by human constraints of time and place.</p>

<p>Sacred Scripture acquires the fullness of its meaning in the figure and preaching of Christ. St. Augustine has commented, “The law was pregnant with Christ” (Augustine, <em>Sermon 196</em>).</p>

<p>On another occasion, he said: “To read the books of the prophets without seeing the coming of Christ is a most insipid practice. Seek therefore to find Christ in these words and they will prove not only delightful but stimulating” (Augustine, <em>Commentary on St. John’s Gospel</em>).</p>

<p>Christ will also enlighten our minds about the riches within Scripture. We’re told in St. Luke: “Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures” (Luke 24:45).</p>

<p>The Jews who refused to believe in the Gospel were left with a chest full of treasure, but without the key to unlock it. St. Paul explained [this situation] to the first Christians at Corinth. He said, “But their minds were hardened. For to this day, when they read the old covenant, that same veil remains unlifted, because only through Christ is it taken away” (2 Cor. 3:14).</p>

<p>The Second Vatican Council says, “The economy of the Old Testament was deliberately so orientated that it should prepare for and declare in prophecy the coming of Christ, redeemer of all men, and of the messianic kingdom. … God, the inspirer and author of the books of [both] Testaments, in his wisdom has so brought it about that the New should be hidden in the Old and that the Old should be made manifest in the New” (Vatican II, <em>Dei verbum</em>, Points 15,16).</p>

<p>In this context, it can be inspiring to read the dialogue between Philip the Apostle and the Ethiopian official from the court of Queen Candace. The Ethiopian was sitting in his chariot reading the Prophet Isaiah. Philip ran up to the man and asked him, “Do you understand what you are reading?” The Ethiopian replied, “How can I, unless someone guides me?”</p>

<p>Philip took a seat in the chariot and “beginning with this Scripture he told him the good news of Jesus” (<em>cf</em>. Acts 8:27-35). He explained the writings of Isaiah by means of the message of Jesus. His catechesis was wonderfully straightforward. Jesus was the key concept.</p>

<p>St. John Chrysostom has commented on this passage from the <em>Acts of the Apostles</em>: “Let us meditate on the importance of our reading the Scriptures with devotion, even during our travels. … Some people excuse themselves from this practice because they’re busy with their family affairs, or because they have military drills, or because they have some worry or other. They think that such matters preclude any serious effort to read and meditate upon Sacred Scripture. …</p>

<p>“This Ethiopian official is an example for all of us: those who have a quiet life, those who belong to the army, those who are officials, those who have chosen a monastic life, those who care for their families at home.</p>

<p>“Let everyone learn,” he says, “that no circumstance should be an impediment for our divine reading. We can do this at home or in the town square or in the public park, or on a trip, or in the company of others, or right in the middle of our work. I beseech you, do not be careless with your reading of the Scriptures” (John Chrysostom, <em>Homilies on Genesis</em>).</p>

<p>From her earliest days, the Church has recommended that the faithful read and meditate on the texts of Sacred Scripture, particularly on the books of the New Testament. There we will find Christ coming out to meet us. Through a few moments each day, we can become best friends with Jesus. Truly, love depends on our prior knowledge.</p>

<p>The books of the Old Testament outlined in advance the path which Christ marked out on His earthly journey (<em>cf</em>. Luke 22:37). Scripture was, in a certain sense, a grand announcement of the Messiah.</p>

<p>The Prophets foretold the day of His coming and they ardently desired to see it (<em>cf</em>. Luke 10:24). The disciples recognized in Christ the fulfillment of all the prophecies (<em>cf</em>. John 1:41-45).</p>

<p>When St. Paul had to defend himself before King Agrippa, he simply stated, “So I stand here testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said would come to pass” (Acts 26:22).</p>

<p>Christ was not bound by the patriarchs and prophets. It was God who inspired them to describe the characteristics of the Son of God. As Jesus said to the leaders of Israel: “If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote of me” (John 5:46).</p>

<p>Later on He said to them, “Your father Abraham rejoiced that he was to see my day. He saw it and was glad” (John 8:56).</p>

<p>Our Lord took upon Himself the types and figures of the Old Testament: the temple (John 2:19), manna (<em>cf</em>. John 6:32), the rock (<em>cf</em>. Matt 16:18), the serpent raised up in the wilderness (<em>cf</em>. John 3:14). His biblical references are unmistakable.</p>

<p>This perhaps explains Our Lord’s frustration with the scribes and the Pharisees. He said to them in St. John, “You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that bear witness to me” (John 5:39).</p>

<p>We read in the Gospel that the heavens and the earth will pass away, but that God’s word will last forever (Luke 21:33). God’s Revelation to man is fulfilled in the person of Christ.</p>

<p>“But now that the faith is founded on Christ, and in this era of grace, the law of the Gospel has been made manifest, there is no reason to inquire of him in that manner, nor for him to speak or to answer as he did then. For, in giving us, as he did, his Son,” says St. John of the Cross, “he has said everything to us together, once and for all, in this single Word, and he has no occasion to speak further” (John of the Cross, <em>Ascent of Mount Carmel, II</em>).</p>

<p>St. Paul in his <em>Letter to the Hebrews</em> says, “For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and spirit, of joints and marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart” (Heb. 4:12). This word is directed to every person who receives it with faith.</p>

<p>The Second Vatican Council has said, “In the sacred books the Father who is in heaven comes lovingly to meet his children and talks with them. And such is the force and power of the Word of God that it can serve the Church as her support and vigor, and the children of the Church as strength for their faith, food for the soul, and a pure and lasting fount of spiritual life” (Vatican II, <em>Dei verbum</em>, Point 21).</p>

<p>The teachings of Jesus are always ‘up to date.’ We’re often amazed at the relevancy of the saga of the Prodigal Son (Luke 15:11-32), of the importance in every age of the leaven to transform the dough (Matt. 13:33), of the reactions of the people cured by Our Lord. Many times we have joined Bartimaeus in asking Jesus for His light: “<em>Domine, ut videam!</em>–Lord, that I may see!” (Luke 18:41). We’ve also used that plea of the publican: “My God, have mercy on me, a sinner!” (Luke 18:13).</p>

<p>Our daily reading of the Gospel can be a source of strength and comfort. The Psalms say, “How sweet are your words to my taste, sweeter than honey to my mouth!” (Ps. 119:103).</p>

<p>When we first heard the idea coming from St. Josemaría that we should try to read the Gospel for two or three minutes every day, we might have had the thought, ‘Can anything good come from doing something for just two or three minutes each day?’ But you may find that fifty years later, you’re still reading the Gospel for two or three minutes each day. That habit has led you to have a great knowledge of the person of Jesus and of the doctrine that He imparts.</p>

<p>Ronald Knox encouraged people to meditate on Our Lord’s passion. He gave an analogy from parish life. He said, “When you have a lot of people singing without any organ accompaniment, there’s a constant tendency for the note to drop all the time. It gets lower and lower as it goes on. Therefore, where the choir isn’t accustomed to singing without accompaniment, every now and then the choirmaster, who has a pitch pipe concealed in his person, gives a little toot in the background to remind them of the higher note which they ought to be taking, and are not.</p>

<p>“You see, we are rather like that. We go on living from day to day without thinking much about how we are living or what we are here for, or whether the things that chiefly interest us are really worth living for; and we can get accustomed to our sins, and feel vaguely that it is a pity we go on committing them, but after all, there doesn’t seem to be much chance of our stopping; and our prayers get very languid and washed out, and we think of very little except our food and our amusements.</p>

<p>“All the time, the note on which our lives are lived is dropping, dropping, till it is ready to die away into our boots, and we don’t notice, just as the choir doesn’t notice, when the note drops. We want that sudden little toot of the pitch pipe to pull us together and screw the note of our lives up again. The pitch pipe we use…is meditation on Our Lord’s Passion” (Ronald A. Knox, A Retreat for Lay People).</p>

<p>We should never turn the pages of the Gospel as if it were just another old book. With what love did our forefathers in the faith care for the Word of God! They went to great lengths to pass it on from generation to generation in all of its integrity.</p>

<p>St. Cyprian has written that the reading of Scripture is like the foundation for the building up of our hope. “It is the means,” he said, “to consolidate our faith, the food for our charity, and our unerring guide on the way of life” (<em>cf</em>. Cyprian, <em>Treatise on Prayer</em>).</p>

<p>St. Augustine compares the teachings of Scripture to “lights shining forth out of the darkness” (Augustine, <em>Commentary on the Psalms</em>). We can find no better beacon for our journey to the Father.</p>

<p>In <em>The Forge</em>, St. Josemaría says, “When you open the Holy Gospel, think that what is written there—the words and deeds of Christ—is something that you should not only know, but live. Everything, every point that is told there, has been gathered, detail by detail, for you to make it come alive in the individual circumstances of your life.</p>

<p>“God has called us Catholics to follow him closely. In that holy Writing you will find the Life of Jesus, but you should also find your own life there.</p>

<p>“You too, like the Apostle, will learn to ask, full of love, ‘Lord, what would you have me do?...’ And in your soul you will hear the conclusive answer, ‘The Will of God!’</p>

<p>“Take up the Gospel every day, then, and read it and live it as a definite rule. This is what the saints have done” (Josemaría Escrivá, <em>The Forge</em>, Point 754).</p>

<p>This is how we can draw abundant fruit from Sacred Scripture. We will unite our prayer with the words of the Psalmist: “Your word, Lord, is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path” (Ps. 119:105).</p>

<p>There’s a story in the Old Testament that narrates the return of the Chosen People to Israel after many years in exile in Babylon. Once they reached Jewish soil, the priest Ezra explains to the people the content of the Law that they had forgotten during the years spent “in a foreign land.” He read from the sacred book, we’re told, “from early morning until midday.” His audience stood and followed the teaching attentively, and “all the people wept” (Neh. 8:2-6;8-10).</p>

<p>Their response is a lament compounded with joy as they hear God’s Law once more, and with grief also, because their previous neglect of the Law had brought about their exile.</p>

<p>When we gather to take part in the Mass, we stand, in an attitude of respect, to hear the Good News that the Gospel always brings us. We have to try to listen to it with a disposition which is attentive, humble, and grateful, because we know that God is speaking to each one of us.</p>

<p>“We should hear the Gospel,” says St. Augustine, “as if Our Lord were present and speaking to us. We must not say, ‘Happy were those who could see him,’ for many of those who saw him crucified him; and many of those who have not seen him have believed in him. The very words that came from Our Lord’s lips were written down and kept and preserved for us” (Augustine, <em>Commentary on St. John’s Gospel</em>).</p>

<p>We can only love someone we know. In order to know Christ, many Christians dedicate some minutes each day to reading and meditating on the Gospels. This practice leads us by the hand to the knowledge and contemplation of Jesus Christ. It teaches us to see Him as the Apostles saw Him, to observe His reactions, to watch the way He behaved, and to listen to His words, which were always filled with wisdom and authority.</p>

<p>The Gospels show Him to us on some occasions moved with compassion at the plight of people in misery. At other times, they show Him full of understanding for sinners, or firm with the Pharisees who were presenting a false image of their religion. He is full of patience with those disciples who often do not grasp the meaning of His words.</p>

<p>It would be very difficult to love Jesus, to get to know Him really well, if we did not frequently hear the Word of God, if we did not attentively read part of the Gospel each day. That reading, perhaps only lasting a few minutes, nourishes and increases our piety.</p>

<p>At the end of each Reading of Sacred Scripture, the priest says, “This is the Gospel of the Lord,” and the faithful reply, “Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ” (<em>Roman Missal</em>).</p>

<p>How do we praise Him? Our Lord is not satisfied with bare words. ‘Show me,’ He says. He wants to be praised with deeds.</p>

<p>We can’t run the risk of forgetting God’s law, of allowing the teaching of the Church to remain in us as little more than truths which are diffuse and inoperative, or of which we have a merely superficial knowledge. For us, this would mean an exile far more devastating than that of Babylon.</p>

<p>God’s greatest enemy in the world is ignorance, “the cause, and as it were,” said Pope John XXIII, “the root of all the evils that poison entire nations and perturb many souls” (John XXIII, Encyclical, <em>Ad Petri cathedram</em>, Point 6, June 29, 1959).</p>

<p>We know well that one great evil that afflicts so many Christians is the lack of doctrinal formation. But what is graver still is that many people are turned astray by error, a sickness even more serious than ignorance.</p>

<p>What a pity if we, because we lack the necessary doctrine, can’t show Christ to them and give them the light they need in order to understand His teaching.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the Gospel of St. Luke, he tells us that he resolved to write down the life of Christ so that we may know the truth of the teachings we have received (Luke 1:1-14).</p>

<p>Each of us, according to the unique circumstances of our life, has the obligation to know Christ’s doctrine in depth. That obligation lasts for as long as our path here on earth shall continue.</p>

<p>“The growth of the faith and the Christian life,” said one writer, “even more in the adverse context with which we are living, needs from us a positive effort and the continuous exercise of our personal freedom. This effort begins when we have come to see our faith as the most important thing in our lives. From this consideration is born an interest in knowing and practicing all that is contained in our faith in God. This leads us to want to follow Christ throughout the complex and changing context of the reality of daily life” (Spanish Episcopal Conference, <em>Witnesses to the Living God</em>, June 28, 1985).</p>

<p>We should never allow ourselves to think that we have sufficient formation. We should never be satisfied with the amount of knowledge about Jesus Christ and His teaching that we have so far acquired.</p>

<p>Love always seeks to know the beloved better. In professional life, doctors or architects or lawyers or whoever, so that they may be good at their profession, never think that they finished studying once they have qualified; they go on learning—always.</p>

<p>And so it is with the Christian. We can apply St. Augustine’s maxim to doctrinal formation: “Did you say, ‘enough’? You have perished” (Augustine, <em>Sermon 169</em>).</p>

<p>The quality of the instrument—because that’s what we all are, instruments in God’s hands—can improve. It can develop new possibilities. Each day we can love a little more and give better example. But we will not achieve this if our understanding is not continually nourished by sound doctrine.</p>

<p>Frank Sheed in his writing said, “I cannot say how often I have been told all sorts of stories about all sorts of people, but I see that the knowledge of God is the most important thing” (<em>cf</em>. Frank J. Sheed, <em>Theology for Beginners</em>).</p>

<p>The so-called ‘plain man’s faith” (‘I believe it all even though I don’t know what it is’) is not sufficient for a Christian in the world who is confronted each day by confusion and a lack of light regarding Christ’s doctrine—the only doctrine that saves—and is daily encountering ethical problems, both new and old, at work, in his family life, and in the environment in which he lives.</p>

<p>A Christian needs to have the answers which enable him to counter the attacks of the enemies of the faith, and to know how to present them in an attractive way.</p>

<p>It takes time and persistence to acquire good formation. Continuity helps us to understand and to incorporate, to make our own, the doctrine that is presented to our understanding. If we are to achieve this, we have first of all to ensure that the right channels are open for sound doctrine to be transmitted and received.</p>

<p>We have to pay attention to our own formation, convinced of the transcendental importance of what we are about. We must make sure that our <em>spiritual reading</em> is in accordance with a well-directed plan. In this way, knowledge builds up gradually in our soul.</p>

<p>We can ask Our Lord that we might have a greater awareness of the fact that His words will not pass away, that they are like seeds in our mind and heart and soul that have to yield an abundant fruit.</p>

<p>We can ask Our Lady that we might take very good care each day of acquainting ourselves with those words which can always have an ever-new fragrance and freshness for us.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p>(<em>Proofread</em>)</p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>We are told in the Book of Genesis, “The Lord God formed man from the dust of the earth, and he breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living being” (Gen. 2:7).</p>

<p>Genesis is very clear about the origin of man, where we have come from, where we’re going.</p>

<p>Ash Wednesday is a day on which Our Mother the Church reminds us of where we have come from. How important in life it is to remember where we have come from, to remember our roots.</p>

<p>Our Mother the Church reminds us that we are dust. “Remember, man, that you are dust, and to dust you shall return” (Gen. 3:19). I often think that whoever dreamed up the ceremony of the ashes was a bit of a genius, because it’s so simple, yet it’s so clear.</p>

<p>You take the palm branches of the previous Palm Sunday, you burn them, they become ash, which really is dirt. Somebody defined dirt once as “matter that is in the wrong place” (Mary Douglas, <em>Purity and Danger</em>). If clay is in the garden, it’s clay; if it’s in the house, it’s dirt.</p>

<p>Our Mother the Church comes along, and she blesses this dirt, as though reminding us that everything that God has created is good and can be made holy.</p>

<p>Then Our Mother the Church does a very curious thing: she takes this ash, and she smears it on our face. She dirties our face.</p>

<p>We spend most of our life trying to keep our faces clean. Our mothers and fathers probably have asked us ever since we were young: Did you wash your face? Did you wash behind your ears?</p>

<p>Our Mother the Church comes along one day each year and dirties our faces for us. As she does so, she says a very important message: “Remember, man...”, as though saying, remember, and don’t ever forget it—who you are, where you come from. It’s a message of humility.</p>

<p>Don’t get any airs and graces because you’re nothing—you’re just dust. Every year the Church reminds us of that message, or gives us the opportunity to hear it, so that we never ever forget it—where we’re going; where we’ve come from.</p>

<p>A man once remarked to me that our churches are full of small, sentimental, material things: holy water, Stations of the Cross, crucifixes, candles, incense.</p>

<p>Among those material things are the ashes. Often those material things can come to mean a lot to us.</p>

<p>Pope St. John Paul II liked to say that we go to the great spiritual messages through physical signs and symbols. Those physical signs and symbols come to be very important. Often little children—that’s what they see, that’s what they understand. They go to the spiritual through the material.</p>

<p>That’s one of the reasons why we have to take very good care of these little, small, material things, because they can transmit wonderful spiritual messages, so that every child gets that message into his mind and heart and soul—that “you are dust”—knows where we’re coming from, knows where we’re going.</p>

<p>Often those material things speak volumes to millions of other people. Cardinal Dolan in New York has said how sometimes after the ceremony of the ashes, he stands on the steps of St. Patrick’s Cathedral and offers ashes to any passersby.</p>

<p>He has said how it’s interesting how many atheists, Hindus, Buddhists, Jews come to receive the ashes. Somehow it speaks to them about the origin of man and the meaning and purpose of our life.</p>

<p>Today, we’re reminded on Ash Wednesday of the importance of dust.</p>

<p>A man in Singapore told me once how his father had died fifty years previous. He was buried in a center city cemetery which was going to be moved to the outskirts of the city because that had become very valuable land.</p>

<p>A family member was asked to come and be present at the exhumation of all the remains. He was there when his father’s grave was dug.</p>

<p>He said after fifty years the only thing that was left was a little bit of the lid of the coffin. He remarked to me: ‘You know, this business of being dust, it’s really true, you know.’</p>

<p>These are very deep lessons for us to learn. We might become the most important man in the world. We might become the most famous Super Bowl player in American history. We might become the Queen of England. We might be a Christian Dior.</p>

<p>But ultimately, we are just dust, and we will go back to being dust.</p>

<p>One time in the 1960s there was a very famous heavyweight boxing champion of the world: Muhammad Ali. He was very vocal. He liked to talk a lot about Allah.</p>

<p>One time he was in Sydney for a title fight. In a press conference, one of the journalists asked him: Look, now that you’re the heavyweight champion of the world, why don’t you give Allah a rest for a while? Why don’t you talk about something else?</p>

<p>Muhammad Ali reached out and he got the journalist’s nostrils with one hand and his lips with the other, and held them tightly closed so that he couldn’t breathe—rather an uncomfortable position to be in, to have your nostrils and your lips in the hands of the heavyweight champion of the world.</p>

<p>The guy was sort of gasping, turning blue in the face. Muhammad Ali said to him, ‘Would you like me to let go?’ And the guy nodded his head. Then he began to breathe.</p>

<p>Muhammad Ali said to him: ‘Can you feel the oxygen going down inside your lung?’ And the guy nodded his head. ‘Can you feel it being taken up by the whole of the globe?’ He said yes. ‘You feel it reaching the last cell of your little toe?’ Again, the guy nodded his head.</p>

<p>Muhammad Ali said: ‘God breathed into man the breath of life.’ In other words, every breath that we take, it’s because God allows us to take that breath, and ‘I’ll talk about Allah as much as I want.’</p>

<p>The simplicity of the ceremony of the ashes and its message is very profound. It speaks to the depth of man in all sorts of ways.</p>

<p>We have the forty days of Lent in front of us—a time that the Church uses to call us to conversion. We’re told in Scripture, “Return to me with all your heart” (Joel 2:12).</p>

<p>The heart is very important in our faith. God reads the heart. The Church invites us in these days to look into our heart, to fashion our hearts after the heart of Christ.</p>

<p>When God looks into our hearts, is He happy with what He finds there? He tells us in Scripture that “out of the heart of man come all sorts of evil things” (Mark 7:21).</p>

<p>Our Mother invites us to change our heart during these days. Try and get out all the bad things that may be there, perhaps through a good Confession. Or through a greater acquisition of graces through the sacraments. Or a more frequent reception of Holy Communion. Or a more frequent Confession, so that we can change our hearts.</p>

<p>“When you pray,” we’re told in the Gospel of today, “go to your room, and shut the door, and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you” (Matt. 6:6).</p>

<p>Prayer is a very personal thing. It’s our own intimate relationship with Our Father God. It’s a heart-to-heart relationship. That’s what friendship is. Friendship with God and friendship with others involve the heart.</p>

<p>Our Lord invites us to take very good care of our hearts. Keep it in good shape; not to allow it to get sullied by anything. If it ever gets a bit messed up, we go back to the sacrament of Confession and we cleanse our hearts.</p>

<p>We say to Our Lord, “Create a clean heart in me” (Ps. 51:10). A new heart. “Take out my heart of stone and give me a heart of flesh” (<em>cf</em>. Ezek. 36:26).</p>

<p>Frequently, in the Responsorial Psalm during these days, we’re going to read: “A humble and contrite heart, O Lord, you will not spurn” (Ps. 51:17). Part of the goal of our Christian life is to develop a humble and contrite heart.</p>

<p>Humble, because we’re always aware of who we are and where we’ve come from—the reality of our own dust. We’re nothing. We can do nothing. It’s only in and through the grace of God that we can achieve anything.</p>

<p>Therefore, we look for that grace in the sacraments. We go closer to God with the hunger: Lord, let me know your face. We seek Him. Prophet Joel says, “Rend your heart and not your garments” (Joel 2:13).</p>

<p>Lent invites us to disconnect a little bit from the exterior things of our life and of this world, and look a little more into our interior. If I want the world to be a better place, then I have to be a better person—more virtuous, more humble, more charitable, more patient, more kind, more pure and chaste.</p>

<p>The Holy Spirit is always ready to transform our hearts, to lead us further in God’s way of truth and holiness. This is the great force in our life: the Holy Spirit. We can ask Our Lord for the grace to use well this time of interior purification.</p>

<p>Sometimes, we think of Lent as a time of exterior purification, which is fine, which is also very true. We go very often to interior purification through exterior purification, through denying ourselves certain pleasures—trying to get up on time, eating a little bit less of what we like and a little more of what we don’t like, not complaining, not criticizing, maybe not indulging in some pleasure or whim that we enjoy.</p>

<p>One time many years ago, I was having lunch with an 85-year-old Irish priest who was in a very faraway place. After lunch, we had coffee and I offered him the sugar for his coffee. He said, “No, thanks, I’m off it for Lent.”</p>

<p>I was rather edified. Here was this 85-year-old priest who was living Lent. I thought, before he was seven years of age his parents must have taught him very deeply about the meaning of Lent.</p>

<p>An awful lot of our spiritual preparation takes place before we’re seven years of age. Try and introduce your children to these practices—very healthy spiritual practices—from an early age. Expose them to the ashes. You’ll see they can come to love these things.</p>

<p>Or if you have an opportunity to get to Mass more frequently during Lent, that’s a very good thing to offer to God—the effort to get up and make the time, and walk to where we have to go, and make the little efforts if it’s raining, et cetera.</p>

<p>Or see if in your family you can make some visits to the poor or the sick, to bring some bit of joy into families that have a little less.</p>

<p>Or perhaps expose your children to the <em>Way of the Cross</em>, a wonderful devotion that we have in our Church, very appropriate for Lent, where we look at Christ on the Cross, follow Him along that journey, which has so many lessons for us.</p>

<p>Christ falls down, but He gets up again. In some ways, the story of our life is there.</p>

<p>He allows His heart to be pierced by a lance. He doesn’t come down off the Cross. He stays there, so that we, when we get temptations to come down off the cross in our work, in our family, in our marriage, we also learn how to stay there.</p>

<p><em>The Way of the Cross</em> teaches us wonderful things, invites us to accept the blows that may come as a means to grow in virtue, in humility, in acceptance of the will of God; to develop our character in all sorts of ways; and to suspend all the bad interior things that may be there inside us—criticisms, judgments.</p>

<p>Sometimes we hear a lot about fasting and abstinence in Lent—the exterior fasting—on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday, but often, it’s the interior things that we have to fast from a little more: from our criticisms, from our judgments, from our complaints, from our comparisons.</p>

<p>We’re told in the Gospel about the Pharisee who said: “God, I thank you that I’m not like the rest of men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector” (Luke 18:11).</p>

<p>There’s a bit of the Pharisee inside each one of us. It’s easy for us to be a modern-day Pharisee, to say all sorts of things externally, but to be completely different on the inside.</p>

<p>That’s why we have to purify the inside, to take care with our heart: “Rend your heart and not your garments” so that when God looks into our hearts and reads our hearts, He sees beautiful things there.</p>

<p>“In our life,” we’re told by St. Josemaría in <em>Christ Is Passing By</em>, “in the life of Christians, our first conversion—that unique moment which each of us remembers, when we clearly understood everything the Lord was asking of us—is certainly very significant.</p>

<p>“But the later conversions are even more important, and they are increasingly demanding. To facilitate the work of grace in these conversions, we need to keep our soul young; we have to call upon our Lord, know how to listen to him and, having found out what has gone wrong, know how to ask his pardon” (Josemaría Escrivá, <em>Christ Is Passing By</em>, Point 57).</p>

<p>When Our Lord called Peter and Andrew, He said, “Come, follow me, and I will make you fishers of men” (Matt. 4:19). That was the beginning. But it wasn’t the end. That was their first conversion.</p>

<p>Later, Our Lord was to say, “Feed my lambs...feed my sheep” (John 21:15-17). There were later and deeper conversions: conversions to a deeper responsibility; conversions from the spiritual to a deeper spirituality, from humility to a deeper humility; from faith to a greater faith.</p>

<p>All the time, Our Lord is leading us forward along the pathway of holiness, the pilgrimage of faith which our Christian vocation is. Lent can be a great stimulus. A lady told me once: I really look forward to Lent and Advent. I hadn’t heard that before; I was rather impressed.</p>

<p>But you see, Lent is a time of great spiritual bonanza. If you have a chance, try and follow the liturgy of Lent closely: the Responsorial Psalms, the Alleluia verse, the Entrance Antiphon.</p>

<p>Smaller parts of the liturgy, you’ll find a great richness there, and a great beauty in the liturgy that will move your heart and whet your appetite for spiritual things, and help you to a much deeper approach to this whole period.</p>

<p>There are many aspirations that you may find in the words of the liturgy, and also in the words of Scripture that we read every day.</p>

<p>Incidentally, somebody told me that we Catholics have more exposure to Scripture than any other Christian denomination, because if we attend Mass regularly, especially on weekdays, we get the choicest parts of Scripture pre-selected for us in a regular way, so that our eyes fall on this great spiritual treasure which is Scripture.</p>

<p>We absorb these things in all these prayers of the liturgy. That’s particularly true of Lent—to savor that richness and to thank God for it.</p>

<p>Possibly from those short prayers, you may get little aspirations that can help you in the rest of the day, like in the <em>Way of the Cross</em>, we say: “We adore you, O Christ, and we bless you, because by your holy cross you have redeemed the world.”</p>

<p>Many little phrases can come to us that can be very meaningful, can help us to supernaturalize our day, and sanctify it. Also, it can give us great peace and joy in leading us to prayer.</p>

<p>One thing we can try and focus on in this month is also the richness of Confession—of our own personal Confession—to get to Confession frequently, to be always in the state of grace, and to see how, if possible, we can reach out to others in the sacrament of Confession.</p>

<p>There was a student in Tokyo once who had heard about doing the apostolate of Confession. In Japan, this population is about 1 percent Christian or Catholic. This student was in the library of the university one time and was thinking, ‘If there are 100 people in this library, possibly one of them is Catholic.’</p>

<p>But then he thought, ‘The chances of bumping up against that Catholic are very rare, but I still have to try and do the apostolate of Confession.’ He leaned over to the student in front of him at the table and said: ‘Hey, how would you like to go to Confession?’</p>

<p>The person said: ‘What’s that?’ And he said: ‘You go into this little box and it’s all dark and there’s a little grill there and you tell the priest all the bad things you have inside you. You get all of them out, you empty everything out, all the garbage, all the rubbish. And then you feel wonderful; you come out of there feeling as light as a feather.’</p>

<p>The guy said: ‘Oh, I think I’d like to try that.’ He began instruction, and three months later, he was baptized and went to Confession.</p>

<p>We never know where that apostolate of Confession is going to lead us in helping many other hearts and souls to grow, and to help the Blood of Christ to get in there and wash away the sins.</p>

<p>Sin is the ugliest reality on the planet. The only thing that we have to be afraid of is sin, because sin is the only thing that will keep us out of heaven.</p>

<p>All the things that the world may present to us as evils are not really evils—not having material things, losing our job, not having this or that, not having money, sickness or disease, or all the other things that can happen.</p>

<p>None of those things can keep us out of heaven—they may be the means to getting to heaven.</p>

<p>Our faith gives us an enormously positive outlook on the world, on creation, on our life. All the different moments of our life are opportunities for us to grow in the goals of our Christian formation—which are holiness and apostolate.</p>

<p>We’re told in the <em>Furrow</em>, “A spirit of mortification, rather than being just an outward show of Love, arises as one of its consequences. If you fail in one of these little proofs, acknowledge that your love for the Love is wavering” (J. Escrivá, <em>Furrow</em>, Point 981).</p>

<p>The Church invites us to deny ourselves little things externally because of the effect that that has interiorly on our soul. We say “no” to the body in order to say “yes” to the soul.</p>

<p>Lent is all about our soul. Often if God permits some pain in our body, or some contradiction, or some reversal of fortune, it’s because He wants our soul to fly. The spiritual realities can become enormously rich and enormously important. We can come to discover the greater reality of the spiritual.</p>

<p>I was passing through Dublin airport one morning at 8 o’clock and a man in a wheelchair beckoned to me to come over. He saw I was a priest and he wanted to talk to me, and initially, he asked me to get an attendant to help him to go to the washroom, which I did.</p>

<p>But then while we waited for the attendant, he said to me, ‘You know, today is a very difficult day for me; it’s the fifth anniversary of the death of my eldest son in a motorbike accident.’</p>

<p>And my heart sank. Eight o’clock in the morning—I wasn’t expecting this.</p>

<p>But he was a man going through a difficult moment, he sees a priest and wants a bit of a spiritual uplift. Then he explained how he was an accountant, he worked in London, but he had developed multiple sclerosis.</p>

<p>The last few years of his life he’d been confined to a wheelchair. His body had become limited at the very height of his career.</p>

<p>But, he said, ‘Suddenly all the spiritual things have come to mean an awful lot to me: I go to the sacraments more frequently, I get to receive the Anointing of the Sick.’ He says, ‘This gives me great joy and a great uplift.’</p>

<p>While we were waiting for the attendant to come, he was sort of giving me a whole catechesis on the sacraments; the effect of the sacraments in his life.</p>

<p>I was the one who benefited from that encounter. I learned so much, and forty years later I’m still talking about it.</p>

<p>There are souls all around us: souls who are looking for a spiritual uplift, souls that need to have their eyes open to the spiritual realities of the world, which are very rich, very beautiful.</p>

<p>Modern materialism, the culture in which we live, tends to tell us that man has no soul. Man is just a thing—that’s why we can abort him or euthanize him. It doesn’t matter; he’s disposable.</p>

<p>But all the great religions of the world speak about the spiritual nature of man—Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, Islam, Christianity—it’s one thing we all have in common: a belief in the spiritual nature of man.</p>

<p>“Have you noticed,” we’re told in the <em>Furrow</em>, “that mortified souls, because of their simplicity, have a greater enjoyment of good things, even in this world?” (J. Escrivá, <em>Furrow</em>, Point 982).</p>

<p>When we deny our body certain pleasures, often it opens the eyes of our soul to deeper realities, to greater pleasures. Spiritual pleasures.</p>

<p>Sometimes as we move on in life, all the things that gave us pleasure earlier—playing sports, maybe, sweets, watching things on TV or movies or whatever—maybe, we find those pleasures pass. We get much greater joy from the spiritual things.</p>

<p>As the body begins to decay, the soul can grow and grow, discover a new youthfulness, a new joy.</p>

<p>We’re told in <em>The Furrow</em>, Point 983: “Without mortification there is no happiness on earth.”</p>

<p>“It’s of great benefit,” says St. Paul, “that we all deny ourselves little pleasures. All things are pleasurable to me, but not all things are necessary or expedient” (<em>cf</em>. 1 Cor. 10:23).</p>

<p>Not all things are necessary. It’s very good in every person’s life that they deny themselves the fruit of a certain tree; certain pleasures that come from certain things.</p>

<p>We all need that salt of mortification. It strengthens our character, strengthens our soul, we grow in fortitude, we know how to say no to ourselves and sometimes to other people, so that we have a certain backbone.</p>

<p>“When you make up your mind to be more mortified,” we’re told, “your interior life will improve and you will be much more fruitful” (J. Escrivá, <em>Furrow</em>, Point 984).</p>

<p>The Church invites us to think of this period of Lent as training for the marathon. Any great Kenyan marathon runner has to run up and down mountains to strengthen their muscles and practice their breathing—all these sorts of things.</p>

<p>This is like a spiritual marathon. The Church gives us an opportunity every year to get into better shape spiritually and to help everybody around us to do the same thing.</p>

<p>“Let us not forget,” we’re told by St. Josemaría, “that in all human activities there must be men and women who, in their lives and work, raise Christ’s cross aloft for all to see, as an act of reparation.</p>

<p>“It is a symbol of peace and of joy, a symbol of the Redemption and of the unity of the human race. It is a symbol of the love that the Most Holy Trinity, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit had, and continues to have, for mankind” (J. Escrivá, <em>Furrow</em>, Point 985).</p>

<p>The cross needs to be there in our life. When we go closer to the Mass, we go closer to the unbloody renewal of the sacrifice of Calvary, which can come to have great meaning for us.</p>

<p>Lent can be a time to be more focused on the Mass, make our attendance more frequent, and work at our Mass a little bit, so that it can truly become the summit and the source of our whole spiritual life, the center and the root.</p>

<p>From a deeper contemplation of Christ on the Cross, we come to understand better the workings of divine grace in our soul.</p>

<p>Fulton Sheen says that when the priest raises his hands to give the absolution and Confession, the Blood of Christ is dripping from his hands (<em>cf</em>. Henry Dieterich, editor, <em>Through the Year with Fulton Sheen</em>).</p>

<p>We’re told in Scripture, “Without the shedding of blood, there is no remission of sin” (Heb. 9:22).</p>

<p>It’s the Blood of Christ that washes away our sins. Blessed be His Most Precious Blood. Lent is also a time when we can contemplate the Precious Blood of Christ. Thank God for shedding His Blood.</p>

<p>In that way, we prepare for the great feast of Easter, the most important feast in the whole of the liturgical year that is there for us to savor in a deeper way every year, in the beauty of its liturgy and the ceremonies, so that more and more, it comes to be a very important part of our life.</p>

<p>We can ask Our Lady that we might never forget that we are dust, that we might savor days like today—Ash Wednesday—and help other people around us too, to come to appreciate the great spiritual richness of days like today.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

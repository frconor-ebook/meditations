<p>(<em>Proofread</em>)</p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>“Now the older son was out in the fields, and, on his way back, as he drew near the house, he could hear music and dancing. Calling one of the servants, he asked what it was all about. The servant told him, ‘Your brother has come, and your father has killed the calf we had been fattening, because he has gotten him back safe and sound.’ He was angry then, and refused to go in. His father came out and began to urge him to come in” (Luke 15:25-28).</p>

<p>There are two types of anger. There is a good anger and a bad anger.</p>

<p>A good anger is an anger to correct, an anger about things that are wrong. It’s the anger of a mother with a two-year-old child. She sees something wrong, she gets angry, she corrects, and then it’s over.</p>

<p>The other type of anger is an anger that smolders on, that’s bitter, full of pride or selfishness. It’s the sort of anger that we see in this older son that’s very much in need of conversion.</p>

<p>In today’s Gospel, we read about the other type of anger: “Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. He found in the temple men selling oxen, sheep, and doves, and money-changers at their tables. And making a kind of whip of cords, he drove them all out of the temple, also the sheep and the oxen. And he poured out the money of the changers and overturned the tables. And to them who were selling the doves, he said, ‘Take these things away, and do not make the house of my father a house of business’” (John 2:13-16).</p>

<p>He went to the temple and He found all these people—money changers, sheep and oxen, the whole marketplace there. He was very calm about the whole thing. He said, ‘OK, it doesn’t matter, I can turn a blind eye to this.’</p>

<p>He was very cool and calm. In this situation, He could have expressed a certain carelessness, a lack of love, a lack of interest, a lack of fortitude—could be a great lack of virtue.</p>

<p>Sometimes it’s a great virtue to react, to see things are wrong and to want to put them right, and to make every effort that’s necessary to put them right—the good anger that’s against wrongdoing that has to be changed in our own lives or in the situations around us.</p>

<p>We could ask Our Lord for that grace to have that good type of anger, to react when things are wrong—not to be careless or lacking in love, or not to go the extra mile, not to be lacking in fortitude.</p>

<p>“We are born children of anger” (Eph. 2:3). There’s a great anger that dominates the world. It can live in the hearts of men. It can cause a lot of trouble, a lot of chaos.</p>

<p>That bad anger can be everywhere. It’s a condition where the tongue works faster than the mind. That bad anger can cause people to hurt each other, to say things they don’t really mean, or that later on they regret.</p>

<p>We can be unable to forgive or to ask for forgiveness. Hearts overcome by anger are difficult to penetrate. And we’re all susceptible to it.</p>

<p>The fact that we try to live lives close to God does not make us immune from these things. We have to try and watch out for that bad anger. Bitterness and resentment can become full-blown.</p>

<p>It’s difficult for the spirit of God to live in a heart that’s full of anger. In such a heart, the spirit of hatred and violence lives. That’s a little bit what we see in the case of the older son.</p>

<p>This older son wasn’t just a particular person. What Our Lord is describing here is a character trait that’s in each one of us. As we get older, we’re all like the older son in the parable—very much in need of conversion of that inner pride.</p>

<p>Anger can be a powerful tool of the devil. It can cause a lot of disunity. The devil enters through anger. We get the impression that this older son was dominated by anger, because he’s not open to be changed or to be converted, even by the gentle words of his father. “His father came out and began to urge him to come in.”</p>

<p>He finds he doesn’t love his brother; he doesn’t love his father. The only one he loves is himself. He’s difficult to say things to, difficult to penetrate.</p>

<p>The Book of Proverbs says, “The fool blurts out every angry feeling, but the wise subdues and restrains them” (Prov. 12:16). It says, “A fool gives full vent to his anger, but a wise person keeps themselves under control” (Prov. 29:11).</p>

<p>That anger can be like a galloping blind horse. Dangerous—it can go all over the place. This older son is full of self-righteousness: ‘I am right.’ ‘I have done the right thing.’ ‘I have not wasted my father’s money.’ ‘I have not misspent it and misused it in all sorts of bad ways. What a good little boy I am.’</p>

<p>He’s patting himself on the back, full of vanity. He’s hard-working, yes. He’s faithful, yes. But he’s also mean, jealous, selfish. He has a bit of a temper. Fast temper, fast pride.</p>

<p>The whole situation of this older brother is ugly. He has a bad type of anger. He puts a distance between himself and people—his brother and his father—people whom he should love.</p>

<p>He should be very happy at the return of his younger brother. But he’s not able to be happy. His heart is not there in his human relationships. His heart is in his own personal things. In this situation, it all comes out. There may be situations in our life that sort of reveal an awful lot.</p>

<p>For many months and years, perhaps he was working away quietly there in his father’s house, and everybody thought, ‘What a good person he is. What a good son he is. Look at that other rascal who’s off, wasting all his father’s money.’</p>

<p>But deep down, this guy was also a bit of a rascal in a worse sort of way, in a way that’s not easy to change or to convert. The conversion needed, which is so deep, was all the more necessary. Then this occasion occurs that his brother comes back and suddenly all is revealed—what he’s really like on the inside.</p>

<p>We could ask Our Lord in our prayer to give us the grace to see what we are really like on the inside, so that we don’t fool ourselves and we don’t fool other people.</p>

<p>All it took was this little piece of news that “your brother has come and your father has killed a fatted calf” and all the ugly, bad things come out of that human heart: jealousy, anger, envy.</p>

<p>He retorted to his father: “All these years I’ve slaved for you and I’ve never once disobeyed any order of yours” (Luke 15:29a). ‘I tick all the boxes for a perfect son, externally.’</p>

<p>All these years he’s been counting the cost, and of course, all these years, the reality is that he hasn’t really been loving his father. He hasn’t really been loving his brother. He hasn’t been growing in charity. He’s been loving himself.</p>

<p>Then this particular event happens, and that reality becomes public. “Yet you never offered me so much as a kid for me to celebrate with my friends” (Luke 15:29b). He’s a complainer. Deep down he’s been complaining.</p>

<p>Jesus, keep me from complaining. Help me to turn to prayer.</p>

<p>There are things to complain about, to leave them before you in the tabernacle, before you on the Cross, so that I don’t become a habitual complainer, which is easy to become—making comparisons, making judgments, criticizing. ‘Why aren’t things better? Why isn’t everyone else better?’ All the time I am the one that’s in need of conversion.</p>

<p>He doesn’t behave like a son of the family. He behaves like a paid servant, like a mercenary. His heart is not there. The mercy of his father irritates him. ‘Why is my father so forgiving and so loving with this terrible brother of mine? To me he gives me nothing.’</p>

<p>He’s blind to the reality which his father tries to make him aware of. “‘My son, you’re always with me. All I have is yours’” (Luke 15:31).</p>

<p>He doesn’t realize how close he is to the heart of his father because he’s so wrapped up in himself. The joy of his brother, and the joy of his family, and the joy of his father leaves a bitter taste. He’s alien to the central ideas of the father. He’s not “united to the vine” (<em>cf</em>. John 15:4).</p>

<p>He’s very much in need of reconciliation; a deep Confession of his miseries. He doesn’t even see. He’s fulfilling his duty, but there’s no love.</p>

<p>Lord, help us to be careful with the fulfillment of our duties. We all have duties to fulfill, and we could get into the ordinary humdrum, day-to-day reality of fulfilling the duties. But all the time, St. Josemaría talks to us about doing it with more love.</p>

<p>Otherwise, we could fall into the situation of this older brother. with a heart that’s difficult to penetrate. ‘I’m doing so much work. Others are not working.’</p>

<p>He’s mean-spirited. The reality is that perhaps others are doing what they can. At the same time, he wants to be the center of attention. The salt of every dish. ‘Why wasn’t I told? How come this is happening? It’s not fair.’</p>

<p>Many things in life are not fair. You can’t look for perfect justice in this world. This world is a world of imperfect justice.</p>

<p>A man in Malaysia told me once, when I asked him how his ten-year-old son was, he told me, ‘He’s going through the age of justice.’</p>

<p>I was wondering, ‘What’s that?’</p>

<p>‘Everything is not fair.’ ‘My sister can stay up to watch the movie and I have to go to bed early. It’s not fair.’ ‘My sister has a free day tomorrow and I’ve got to go to school. It’s not fair.’ ‘My sister has less homework and I have more homework. It’s not fair.’ Everything was not fair.</p>

<p>We could spend our whole life in the “age of justice” and never grow out of it. We need a more mature approach to life. Thank God for the talents and abilities that He’s given to us.</p>

<p>If I have a greater capacity to get things done or to fulfill this job, the talent in this area will be wonderful. It will help me to push as far as I can in that area and to realize that I have bigger faults in other areas, and that other people have great talents in other areas.</p>

<p>This older son is complaining, ‘I’m not appreciated. Nobody cares about me.’ He’s talking like a spoiled child full of vanity and envy and jealousy. ‘All my efforts are not recognized.’ He hasn’t learned to forget about himself.</p>

<p>All through the writings of St. Josemaría, there’s a phrase that keeps cropping up, which is, “Forget yourself” (Josemaría Escrivá, <em>Furrow</em>, Points 640, 793; 947; <em>The Forge</em>, Point 97).</p>

<p>Learn how to focus on others. We solve all our own problems by thinking about the others. If we’re so involved in our own little problems, then we’ll be so easily aroused to anger. The devil can get in there very easily with all sorts of bad things.</p>

<p>He’s full of justice and responsibility, but he has no mercy. No mercy for his brother, no mercy for his father. He crucifies his brother with his pride. His heart is cold.</p>

<p>Lord, help me not to have a cold heart. Warm up my heart. Don’t even let it be lukewarm. I want to be on fire with love of you and love of others, to have burning zeal. “Come Holy Spirit, and kindle in our hearts the fire of your love.”</p>

<p>When we look at the ugliness of this particular fellow, Lord, help us to run a mile from being this type of person, because the potential is there in each one of us.</p>

<p>He’s not happy, because now he has to share what he has with his brother. The brother has come back. ‘All this was going to be mine, and now I have to share.’</p>

<p>Sharing can be a very challenging business. We see when parents die and family members have to share the land or share the products—all sorts of ugly things can come out, because we’re selfish a bit by nature. We have to learn how to share.</p>

<p>He has a bone to pick with his father. He’s very independent-minded. To be independent-minded can be a good thing, but it can also be a bad thing. He wants things his own way. He doesn’t want what the father wants.</p>

<p>In the course of our life, each one of us has to work under other people. We all have a supervisor. We all have a boss. Our job in that particular situation is to make our boss happy, to make our supervisor happy.</p>

<p>Probably if your supervisor or your teacher is happy with you and with your work, then God is happy with you. Our first duty is to make the person above us happy, not to want things our own way or to do things the way we want to do them, but to do them the way our boss wants them done—to bend to their will.</p>

<p>That’s how we serve and improve our service. And all through our life we will always have somebody asking us to do things or paying us to do things, and they want them done a certain way.</p>

<p>Even if we don’t like that way or think there’s a better way, for this particular moment, for this particular boss, I have to try and serve them the way that they want to be served. Refinement in service.</p>

<p>This guy had no refinement. He wants things his own way all the time. He was older, so he should have known better. We could have expected a greater maturity from him.</p>

<p>But instead, we find the opposite. He’s immature. We could be mature in age or physically, but we might be very immature on the inside.</p>

<p>He doesn’t realize that everything that he has is a gift of God. If he realized that everything he had was a gift of God, he would be so happy—so happy that he’s able to work, so happy that he has such a good father, so happy that his brother has come back, which was the most important thing.</p>

<p>Because he’s all wrapped up in himself, he misses the most important thing. He takes it all for granted. He forgets others, and he forgets that others need forgiveness. They need tenderness. They need mercy.</p>

<p>This son who had come back after a very rough patch in his life—he was in need of being handled with kid gloves, been through a lot, learned the great lessons of life. But this fellow was so cold-hearted. He had no tenderness in him.</p>

<p>We could examine our conscience and see: Lord, do I have those tender words or actions for people who live around me or work with me? Should I lift them up, make them feel better if they make a mistake?</p>

<p>In the last few days, there’s been this, in some ways, very terrible story, a thing that happened in a school in Madrid, a girl’s school, I think it was a kindergarten school.</p>

<p>A mother was collecting her children. She had the children in the car, and then she goes to move the car, and instead of going into reverse, she goes forward. She hits three six-year-old kids, kills one of them, and badly injures two others. All in the school car park.</p>

<p>Heart-rending story. The secretary of the school, the mother of the child that dies, comes out to see her dead child. Of course, it’s a heartbreaking moment. Then she sees the other mother, who has been the one who has made this mistake in the car, and goes to embrace her and console her.</p>

<p>It’s come out in all the newspapers in Spain (Aleteia, <em>Faith shines through tragedy at Madrid Catholic School</em>, November 5 and 10, 2021). A heart-rending moment, but a wonderful virtue in this difficult time: knowing how to give tenderness, to give forgiveness; to reach out to others, even though your own heart is breaking.</p>

<p>A beautiful example of virtue on a national scale and level. Here we are talking about it. It’s what the school of sanctity is all about: a tender heart.</p>

<p>Lord, give us that heart that helps us to reach out to others, to give them what they need in certain moments.</p>

<p>The problems and the sufferings of his father and of his brother are foreign to this particular fellow, whereas this woman, completely the opposite. In that terrible moment, when God has taken her child, she sees somebody else in need of consolation, of forgiveness, of help, and she reaches out.</p>

<p>If we view things from the outside like a stranger, we won’t know how to react with charity and love and forgiveness and tenderness in those moments. We won’t know what to say or what to do.</p>

<p>God is using this tragic event to give great lessons of charity to people all over the world—great catechesis.</p>

<p>This son, he doesn’t hope to see his brother again. He doesn’t receive him with joy. Perhaps he was wishing that his brother would stay away, just feeding the pigs, and die in the gutter someplace, so he can forget all about him.</p>

<p>He’s very much in need of conversion. The happiness that his brother is found, the meaning of life, the change that has come about—it leaves a bitter taste in his heart.</p>

<p>The father comes out and speaks gently to him, man to man, calls him to conversion. “My son, all that I have is yours” (Luke 15:31). He calls him his son, imploring from him that fraternal understanding, that respect for the person, that joyful apostolate of example.</p>

<p>Forget yourself. Reach out to others. Conquer your anger. Don’t let the devil dominate this moment that can be a tremendous moment in our family, a great moment of great significance.</p>

<p>But the son is so wrapped up in himself that he has no time for these great moments. He wants all the glory ‘to me.’ He doesn’t accept the will of God. He’s insensitive to correction. He seems to say to his father, ‘Don’t come with your stories to me. I have no time for you, this brother of mine. No time for you either, with your nice, sweet words.’ Tremendous insensitivity.</p>

<p>Lord, help us to be very sensitive to correction. May I be a person that’s easily able to be talked to, to be told things.</p>

<p>You see, sometimes if we’re working in some department, or we’re doing some job and our supervisor comes along and says, ‘You missed a little piece here on the floor,’ or ‘That could be a little bit done better there,’ or ‘You forgot to put a fork on this table,’ or ‘You pressed the wrong button on the washing machine’—we might explode!</p>

<p>‘Somebody has told us these things. How dare they tell us these things!’ We can be full of pride and vanity. We can be like a stick of dynamite.</p>

<p>We have to learn how to control those sorts of reactions, because we have to learn how to work with other people, how to live with other people. Everybody should be able to tell us anything at any moment, because ultimately, they’re not out to try and make us suffer. They’re trying to make us into a better professional person.</p>

<p>It’s a great service that they tell us things. It’s a sign of confidence that they feel that they can tell us something without us exploding like a stick of dynamite. We’ll take it, we’ll be sensitive, we’ll be grateful, because it’s a great act of charity. It helps us to be better, which is ultimately what we want.</p>

<p>This older brother, he knows it all already. He has it all figured out. He’s full of self-exaltation. I can imagine he’s impossible to work with, impossible to live with.</p>

<p>That picture that Our Lord paints of this person on the inside is very relevant for each one of us. ‘I need to change. I need to be better. I need to ask people also, maybe in spiritual direction, what are my great faults? Where do you think I can improve, to prevent me from making big mistakes in my life?’—like this fellow did.</p>

<p>Or also, all those money changers in the temple, or all the people that brought the oxen and the cattle into the temple—what were they thinking? What did they think this place was? They converted it into a marketplace. You get the impression they must all have been very, very stupid.</p>

<p>And yet, we can all be very stupid. We can use things for the completely opposite purpose for which they have been created. We can mistake the meaning and the purpose of certain great instruments that God has given to us. We could be the ones that lead our goats or our cattle or something into some sacred place. Our Lord has come along and corrects them in a very clear way.</p>

<p>This older son—he sees only the sins of others. He refuses to see his own imperfections.</p>

<p>“Lord, that I may see” (Luke 18:41). Help me to see myself as others see me. Help me to have that humility of spirit, so that I realize that I have defects and that I need to change.</p>

<p>If we love others with a heart that’s full of pride, then our love becomes conditional. We will show love only if other people behave according to our will, if they conform to be what we want them to be.</p>

<p>This fellow was living in a house full of love and mercy, with such a good father. But he doesn’t get it.</p>

<p>Lord, prevent me from being in such a good atmosphere, such a good family—such tenderness around me, such charity—and yet I don’t get the message. What a tragedy!</p>

<p>This parable helps us to look into the depths of the heart of man, the depths of the hearts of God’s children. See what we’re all like on the inside.</p>

<p>This older son becomes the example to avoid. The younger son is the one to imitate. The older son is detestable, but yet God still loves him. He still goes out to him: “All that I have is yours.”</p>

<p>Even when we are detestable on the inside, full of misery and wretchedness, failure, God still loves us, reaches out to us, invites us to a new conversion.</p>

<p>We could ask Our Lady to help us to understand these types of anger, so that we might have a lot of the good anger, whereby we want things to be right, we want to put things right, and that we might have none of the bad anger.</p>

<p>If it’s there, that we might conquer it with a deeper humility, which comes as a result of getting to know ourself a little better on the inside, just like Our Lord has given us this older son for us to examine in concrete ways, so that we can know ourselves a little better.</p>

<p>Mary, may you lead me along the pathway of a deeper humility.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

Conor Donnelly</p>

<p>(<em>Proofread</em>)</p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>There was a lady from a small village in the Mogilev region of the Russian Empire, in what is now Belarus. Her name was Bryna.</p>

<p>In her youth, she was engaged to a man called Herschel, who left for America with promises and dreams. A year later, he sent money for her passage. In those days before visa requirements, she boarded a ship to join him, carrying nothing but hope for a better life.</p>

<p>They married and settled in Amsterdam, New York—not the glamorous city, but a small mill town. Bryna gave Herschel seven children: six daughters and finally, a son. They named him Issur, though everyone else called him Izzy.</p>

<p>But the American dream turned into an American nightmare.</p>

<p>Herschel, who had been a horse trader in Russia, became a ragman in America, collecting junk and scraps to sell. What little money he made, he spent on alcohol and on gambling with his friends. He was known throughout the neighborhood as a troublemaker and a bully. Worse still, he was cruel at home—so cold that he never once called his wife by her name. He addressed her only as, “Hey, you!”</p>

<p>The family lived in crushing poverty. Bryna, who couldn’t read or write, worked her fingers raw, taking in laundry and doing whatever job she could find, but it was never enough. The children often went hungry.</p>

<p>She would send Izzy to the Jewish butcher with a simple request: “Please give me the bones you don’t need anymore.” She would take those discarded bones and boil them for hours, making a thin soup that kept her family alive for days.</p>

<p>Years later, her son—by then known as Kirk Douglas—remembered those days: “When it was a good day,” he said, “we would eat omelets made with water. When it was a bad day, we wouldn’t eat at all.”</p>

<p>But Bryna never gave up. She held her family together through sheer force of will, and she believed in her son with a fierceness that defied their circumstances. When Izzy talked about becoming an actor—a ridiculous dream for a poor kid from a ragman’s family—she encouraged him.</p>

<p>Issur Demsky left that small town and became Kirk Douglas. He became a Hollywood legend, starring in classics like <em>Spartacus</em>, <em>Paths of Glory</em>, and <em>Lust for Life</em>. But he never forgot where he came from, and he never forgot who made it possible.</p>

<p>In 1949, when Kirk formed his own film production company, he gave it a name: Bryna Productions. Not after himself; after his mother.</p>

<p>In 1958, Bryna Productions released <em>The Vikings</em>, an epic film starring Kirk Douglas and Tony Curtis. It was one of the year’s biggest movies.</p>

<p>Kirk decided his mother needed to see something. He took her by the arm and led her to Times Square in New York City. Among the flashing lights and enormous advertisements, he showed her a massive poster that said: “Bryna Presents <em>The Vikings</em>.” Her name. The woman who couldn’t read. The woman who boiled bones for soup. The woman who was called “Hey, you!” by her husband. Her name was on a billboard in Times Square.</p>

<p>Bryna Demsky burst into tears, perhaps the first tears of pure joy she’d ever cried in her difficult life.</p>

<p>That December, just months after seeing her name in lights, Bryna passed away at the age of 74. Kirk was with her until the very end. Her last words to him were simple and loving: “Izzy, my son, don’t be afraid. This happens to everyone.” Even in death, she was still trying to comfort him.</p>

<p>Kirk Douglas lived to be 103 years old. He became one of Hollywood’s greatest stars, a producer, a philanthropist, and father of actor Michael Douglas. But until his death in 2020, he always said the same thing: everything he achieved was because of his mother.</p>

<p>The woman who couldn’t write her own name gave the world a legend. The woman who had nothing gave her son everything. The son who became a star made sure the world remembered her name.</p>

<p>Every film that bore the title “A Bryna Production” was a love letter from a grateful son to the mother who believed in him when he had nothing but dreams. She deserved to see her name in lights. And her son made sure she did.</p>

<p>From this story, we can be mindful in our prayer of how our earthly life is short and fleeting. We have to take advantage of the noble things of the earth so as to win heaven.</p>

<p>We might not be rich in this world, but we can be rich before God, and that’s the sort of richness that we have to try to acquire.</p>

<p>“Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where dust and moth consume and thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven” (Matt. 6:19–20). Our passage upon this earth is a time of testing. Our Lord Himself has given this particular time to us, and we have to try and make use of everything: the difficulties, the challenges, the crosses, the failures.</p>

<p>St. Paul says to the Hebrews, “For here we have no lasting city, but we seek for the city which is to come” (Heb. 13:14). That’s what it’s all about.</p>

<p>On a certain day, Our Lord will come to settle accounts with us, to determine how well or ill we have administered His gifts. His gifts include intelligence, health, material goods, a capacity for friendship, the power to give joy to those around us.</p>

<p>Our Lord will come only once, perhaps when we least expect Him, like a thief in the night (Matt. 24:43), like lightning flashing across the sky (Matt. 24:27). He wants to find us well prepared.</p>

<p>If we tie ourselves down to this world, forgetting that our end is in heaven, that can lead us to live a disoriented life of complete idiocy. How important it is that we get to a retreat once a year, that we’re reminded of those eternal truths and never lose sight of them, which can easily happen.</p>

<p>We have to walk with our feet on the ground, taking care to safeguard our future and the future of those who depend on us. But we can’t forget that we are pilgrims, no more than “actors in a show,” as St. John Chrysostom says. “No one is permanently made king or wealthy, since at the end of the performance, we will all find ourselves as paupers” (John Chrysostom, <em>Homily on Lazarus</em>).</p>

<p>Worldly goods are but the means for us to attain the goal which Our Lord has pointed out for us. Those worldly goods can never become the be-all and the end-all of our existence.</p>

<p>Our life on earth is short and limited. Perhaps we think of death in terms of something remote, as if we will live forever. But Our Lord tells us that our days are numbered. We’re in the hands of God. Within a few years—maybe a few months or a few days, perhaps not that many—we will find ourselves face to face with Him.</p>

<p>Meditating on our final end can motivate us to sanctify our work, redeeming the time, as we strive to make up for lost time (Eph. 5:16). It should help us to take advantage of our circumstances in order to make reparation for sins and to become detached from earthly goods.</p>

<p>One day, like any other day, will be our last day on earth. Today, thousands of people have died, or will die, in the most diverse circumstances.</p>

<p>All those people were probably unaware that their time was up, that they would have no more time to improve. Some have died with their hearts immersed in things of little or no importance in terms of eternal life.</p>

<p>Others have died who have been involved in exactly the same activities, but have kept their sights on God. It’s these latter people who have come into possession of that marvelous treasure “which neither dust nor moth consumes” (Matt. 6:20).</p>

<p>St. Paul tells the Colossians, “If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on the things that are above, not on things that are on the earth” (Col. 3:1–2). Things of the world last only a relatively short period of time. They can’t fulfill the longings of the human heart.</p>

<p>The Book of Wisdom says, “The life of man on earth is brief” (Wis. 2:1). The greater part of it can be spent in pain and suffering. Every life passes like the wind. Barely a trace is left behind (<em>cf</em>. Ps. 90:10).</p>

<p>In the best of cases, one might amass a great fortune, only for it to be left to others. What does all this pain and suffering add up to? Is it all for nothing? The Book of Ecclesiastes says, “Vanity of vanities! All is vanity” (Eccles. 1:2).</p>

<p>In the face of this emptiness and inconsistency, all this pointlessness, God is “the rock of our salvation.” The Psalm says, “Let us come into his presence with thanksgiving. Let us make a joyful noise to him with songs of praise” (Ps. 95:1-2).</p>

<p>At the same time, the human heart has a tremendous capacity to seek the things of the world without paying any attention to the transcendent meaning of life. The human heart tends to become attached to worldly goods as the one and only goal in life, forgetting what is really important.</p>

<p>Our Lord takes advantage of a question about inheritance to teach us about the true worth of things in the light of eternity. He says there was once a rich man, who “having had a good harvest from his land, thought to himself, ‘What am I to do? I have not enough room to store my crops.’ And he said, ‘This is what I will do: I will pull down my barns and build bigger ones, and store all my grain and my goods in them. And I will say to my soul: My soul, you have plenty of good things laid by for many years to come; take things easy. Eat, drink, have a good time.’ But God said to him, ‘Fool! This very night the demand will be made for your soul, and this hoard of yours, whose shall it be then?’” (Luke 12:16-20).</p>

<p>So it is when someone stores up treasures for himself instead of becoming rich in the sight of God. Our Lord brings up the subject of death, of our own death, to make His point.</p>

<p>He says the land of this man brought forth plentifully, and he planned about how he was going to increase all of those things. Then he has to hear the strong words from Our Lord: “Fool.” It’s about the only time in Scripture that that word is used.</p>

<p>Our Lord teaches us that putting our hearts into the pursuit of wealth and worldly well-being is foolishness. What we have to strive for is to be rich before God, like Bryna was, in spite of all the difficulties.</p>

<p>Neither happiness nor authentic human life itself are founded on worldly goods. We’re told in St. Luke, “A man’s life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions” (Luke 12:15).</p>

<p>The rich man discloses his ‘value system’ in his mental dialogue. He sees himself in the story in a very secure position because he has great resources. He bases his stability and his happiness on his wealth.</p>

<p>For him, as for many people, living is a matter of enjoying as much pleasure as possible. It is to do as little as need be, to eat, to drink, to have a good time, to lay up ample goods for many years. That’s his ideal. In his life, there’s no reference to God, much less to other people. He sees no need to share his goods with others less fortunate than himself.</p>

<p>And how does he plan to maintain his thoroughly materialistic lifestyle? “I will store up for myself.” Yet in the end, all his calculations are for nothing. The things of this world give a fragile and insufficient security, since our lives will never be fulfilled without God.</p>

<p>During our time of prayer, we can ask ourselves: where is my heart? Because we know that our destination is heaven, we have to make positive and concrete acts of detachment with regard to what we own and what we use.</p>

<p>We can ask ourselves: how much do we share our goods with the needy? One criterion that St. Josemaría liked to give to families was that if you’re spending money on a celebration, or a holiday, or some special occasion, make sure a portion of what you spent is given to some needy family or to some worthwhile cause.</p>

<p>It fosters a social consciousness, something we have to infect people with all over the world, particularly our children; to think about others, particularly in moments when we’re having a good time.</p>

<p>We can ask ourselves: how much time and wealth do we contribute to apostolic works? Could we be doing a little bit more? Are we working at being rich before God? Are we using those difficult circumstances that life may have dealt us, with the will of God, like Bryna, to produce great people, like her son, who go on to build up the culture of the world?</p>

<p>At the moment of death, the state of our soul is fixed forever. Afterwards, it’s impossible to change. The destiny which awaits us is the consequence of our behavior on earth. The Book of Ecclesiastes says, “If a tree falls to the south or to the north, in the place where the tree falls, there it will lie” (Eccles. 11:3).</p>

<p>This is the reason for Our Lord’s frequent warnings to be on watch, to be vigilant (<em>cf</em>. Matt. 24:42-44, Mark 13:32-37).</p>

<p>Death is not the end of our existence, but the beginning of a new life. Christians cannot ‘write off’ or minimize the importance of our temporal existence since it is the very means by which we prepare for our definitive life with God in heaven.</p>

<p>To yield a rich harvest before God we have to sanctify this same ordinary life and the use of material goods. Every other lifestyle is built upon sand. The Psalms say, “Surely every man stands as a mere breath! Surely man goes about as a shadow!...man heaps up, and knows not who will gather” (Ps. 39:5-6).</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the goods of this world are intended for the glory of God, we should use them with a sense of detachment, not complaining either when these goods may be lacking. The absence of some good, as in Bryna’s case, if it is God’s will, should not take away our peace. We should know how to be happy in times of prosperity and in adversity.</p>

<p>Whether we are rich or poor, we should share what we have with others, by creating new jobs—if that is in our power, by promoting works of culture and formation, by giving generously to the good works of the Church.</p>

<p>A very good question for many people to ask themselves is: where would I be without the Church? All the value systems, good things the Church has given to me—education, formation, care of my soul. We have to propagate that as much as possible, and to bring that formation to the ends of the earth.</p>

<p>By considering our death, we also learn how to make good use of the days that remain to us. St. Josemaría said, “My children, the world is slipping through our fingers. We cannot lose any time, for time is short. I understand St. Paul very well when he writes to the Corinthians, ‘<em>Tempus breve est</em>.’ How brief is the time of our sojourn upon this earth! For a coherent Christian, these words ought to ring true in the depths of the soul. They are a reproach for a lack of generosity and a constant invitation to loyalty. Truly, we have so little time to love, to give, to do penance” (Josemaría Escrivá, <em>Newsletter No. 1; cf. Friends of God</em>, Point 39).</p>

<p>We could ask ourselves: are we going to allow our hearts to be tied to the things of this world?</p>

<p>Meditation on the eternal truths is a good antidote against sin and a real help towards giving a Christian meaning to life. We should renew our resolution to expose ourselves to those eternal truths in a regular way, particularly yearly on a retreat, so that those ideas don’t escape our conscience and our thoughts.</p>

<p>Those thoughts can inspire us to pay proper attention to our daily work, to our relations with other people, and to our duties in charity towards those in need. That will be our way to heaven. In that way, we will be truly rich before God.</p>

<p>We can ask Our Lady that she might help us to make good use of our circumstances, situations that God has willed for us to grow in holiness, to sow seeds, to give ourselves to the formation of our children and our grandchildren, and to really have that great yearning in our mind and heart to be rich in relation to the things of God.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

Conor Donnelly</p>

<p>(<em>Proofread</em>)</p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>Our Lord tells us in St. John, “My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to accomplish his work” (John 4:34).</p>

<p>Obedience is the submission of our will to the will of another.</p>

<p>On many occasions and throughout His life, Our Lord humbly submitted His will to the will of His Father: “Father, if it is possible, let this chalice pass from me; yet not my will, rather yours be done” (Matt. 26:39).</p>

<p>Our Lord gives great importance to the virtue of obedience.</p>

<p>He wants each one of us to die to ourselves, to our self-love, to our egoism—very often through obedience to the people that He has placed there to guide us.</p>

<p>For children, it’s parents. For husbands, it may be wives; for wives, husbands. For other people, the people that God has placed with the grace of state to guide them.</p>

<p>He says in St. John: “Amen, Amen, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falling into the ground dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it brings forth much fruit. He that loves his life shall lose it, and he that hates his life in this world will keep it until life everlasting” (John 12:24-25).</p>

<p>Part of our Christian vocation in following Our Lord is to try and live this virtue well.</p>

<p>There are times when it may be easy, but there can be times when it costs, but obedience is always fruitful. The Book of Proverbs says, “The obedient person speaks victory” (Prov. 21:28). God loves the obedient soul.</p>

<p>Also in St. John, Our Lord says: “Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say? ‘Father, save me from this hour’? But for this cause, I came unto this hour” (John 12:27).</p>

<p>Our Lord came to obey, to do His Father’s will.</p>

<p>We’re told on another occasion: “What do you think?” He said.</p>

<p>“A certain man had two sons. And coming to the first, he said, ‘Son, go work today in my vineyard.’ And he, answering, said, ‘I will not.’ But afterward, being moved with repentance, he went. And coming to the other, he said in like manner.</p>

<p>“And he, answering, said, ‘I go, sir,’ and he went not. Which of the two did the father’s will? They said to him: ‘The first.’ Jesus said to them: ‘Amen I say to you, that the publicans and the harlots shall go into the kingdom of heaven before you’” (Matt. 21:28-31).</p>

<p>That’s a rather interesting phrase worth thinking about.</p>

<p>We haven’t come to do our own will or to impose our will on other people. Our Lord wants the humble submission of our will.</p>

<p>St. Paul says to the Philippians: “For let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus, for being in the form of God, he did not think being equal to God a thing to be clung to, but emptied himself, taking the form of a slave and being made in the likeness of men. In the form of man, he humbled himself, becoming obedient unto death, even unto death on a cross. For which cause God has also exalted him and given him the name which is above all names, so that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those that are in heaven and on earth and under the earth” (Phil. 2:5-10).</p>

<p>One of the ways in which we empty ourselves and live this virtue of humility—authentic humility—in our deeds is through this virtue.</p>

<p>The whole of Our Lord’s life could be summed up in the two words: “He obeyed.”</p>

<p>“He went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was obedient to them. And his mother treasured all these things in her heart” (Luke 2:51).</p>

<p>Our Lord also emphasized: “I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me” (John 6:38).</p>

<p>Initially, it might be difficult to see Our Lord’s will.</p>

<p>Close to where we lived in Singapore, there was a community of nuns, some of them very elderly—elderly Irish nuns who had been all over Asia. Many had looked after orphanages in many faraway places.</p>

<p>Then one elderly nun died. One of the other young nuns told me a story that when this lady was 67, she was asked to go and start an orphanage in Fiji.</p>

<p>But she had been the Superior of many orphanages in different places, and now she was a bit old and she was a bit tired, and she didn’t really feel like going to Fiji.</p>

<p>She was sort of complaining: “I’ve always been the one to go and start in all these places, and now I’m this age,” and she said, “I won’t go. I won’t, I won’t, I won’t, I won’t, I won’t.”</p>

<p>Then the nun finished her story, saying, “You know, in the end, she went.”</p>

<p>It was a rather beautiful, formative story.</p>

<p>Initially, she didn’t feel one single bit like obeying. Every human cell in her body felt like rebelling, this holy lady.</p>

<p>But after prayer and consideration, she came to see what the will of God was, and so she went forward to live out her vocation in and through this virtue.</p>

<p>Our Lord said in St. Luke: “I have a baptism with which to be baptized, and how great is my distress until it is over!” (Luke 12:50).</p>

<p>“See, we are going up to Jerusalem,” we’re told in St. Luke, “and everything that is written about the Son of Man by the prophets will be accomplished” (Luke 18:31).</p>

<p>“For this reason, the Father loves Me because I lay down my life in order to take it up again” (John 10:17).</p>

<p>In the whole course of our Christian vocation, there may be many situations in our marriage, in our family, in our workplace, where we are called to lay down our life: to work in this particular place; to fulfill this particular job; to finish this particular task that we have in front of us.</p>

<p>He said: “No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord” (John 10:18).</p>

<p>St. Josemaría liked to say that sometimes the most supernatural reason for doing things is because I want to, because I see this thing as the will of God (<em>cf</em>. Josemaría Escrivá, <em>Christ Is Passing By</em>, Point 17).</p>

<p>This is what is being asked of me, and so I interiorize the requests. I don’t do something just because I have been asked to do this, or I have been told to do that. I do it because I want to, because I see this is the will of God, the Holy Spirit speaking to me, and this is His will for me in this particular moment. Therefore, I do it of my own accord and with great personal responsibility.</p>

<p>“I have the power to lay it down,” He says, “and I have the power to take it up again. I’ve received this command from my Father” (John 10:18).</p>

<p>In the Book of Samuel, we’re told: “I prefer obedience rather than sacrifice” (<em>cf</em>. 1 Sam. 15:22).</p>

<p>Sometimes the temptation might be to perform some great sacrifice that may be attractive to us or looks interesting, but possibly God is not asking us for that big sacrifice. Maybe He just wants us to obey in a humble way the ordinary little things that God asks of us.</p>

<p>In <em>The Forge</em>, Point 231, it says, “A sick man is brought to Jesus, who looks at him. —Contemplate the scene closely and meditate upon his words: take heart, my son.</p>

<p>“This is what Our Lord says to you when you feel the weight of your errors. Have faith! In the first place: faith. And then allow yourself to be carried like the paralytic did: with interior and submissive obedience!”</p>

<p>This virtue is supposed to have certain characteristics.</p>

<p>It’s meant to be supernatural: I see this thing as coming from God. I’m not just obeying a human person. I don’t look at the human qualities of the person who’s asked me to do this thing. They might be younger than me; they might be less qualified; they might be this, they might be that; they might be less virtuous.</p>

<p>But they have been placed in this particular situation to guide me. Therefore, with faith, I have to try and see the hand of God working in and through this person.</p>

<p>Our obedience should be intelligent. It’s not a blind obedience. We pass that obedience through our reason.</p>

<p>If there is some particular thing that we find problematic, then we ask about it. We ask for clarification. If we’re still told to go ahead, it’s better to go ahead and do it, with faith, with a supernatural outlook, with trust in God.</p>

<p>When we’re asked to do something, our obedience should be prompt.</p>

<p>“Mary went with haste into the hill country” (Luke 1:39). “The shepherds went with haste” to Bethlehem (Luke 2:16).</p>

<p>In Scripture, as soon as people see what the will of God for them is, they go quickly to fulfill that will.</p>

<p>One lady advised her child when her child began to have children after marrying. When he asked for advice on how to bring up children, this experienced lady said, ‘Teach them to obey.’</p>

<p>One great lesson that parents should try and instill in their children is to teach them to obey, and to obey with haste.</p>

<p>When I say something, will you give that priority? When I call you, you come. When I tell you to make your bed, you make your bed. When I tell you to be on time for meals, you be on time for meals.</p>

<p>The domestic Church has to cultivate many virtues. A family is meant to be a school of virtues, and this is one of them. It’s a great preparation for a child for their future marriage, for their future work, for the future contribution they have to make to society.</p>

<p>Our obedience should be interior. We don’t just obey exteriorly, grinding our teeth and getting on with it.</p>

<p>Because we see that indication was coming from the hand of God, we make it our own with our mind and heart. I do this because I want to, because I see this is the will of God.</p>

<p>God gives us the grace and the help to be able to fulfill that thing.</p>

<p>Sometimes our reason can become unreasonable. What we are asked to do might seem unreasonable.</p>

<p>There was a little girl once, five years of age, who was quite talkative, particularly when she went visiting her neighbors. One day she remarked to the lady who lived next door, “I don’t think my mother knows anything about raising children.”</p>

<p>The lady next door asked, “Well, how is that?” She said, “She makes me go to bed when I’m not sleepy, and she makes me get up when I am sleepy.”</p>

<p>Sometimes obedience does not seem reasonable. But yet, looked at from a different perspective, it can be a different story.</p>

<p>And lastly, our obedience should be responsible. When we’re asked to do something, we report back about that thing that we have done.</p>

<p>We help the person who asked us to do something to be at peace: this job has been done, and I can now tick it on my list—whether it’s our boss, whether it’s our spouse, whether it’s our parent, whoever it may be.</p>

<p>Obedience breeds peace in the humble soul. When we do what we’re asked to do, then we can relax. We’ve done the best thing. We’ve done the will of God.</p>

<p>A principal obstacle to our obedience can be pride: pride expressed as rebellion, a critical spirit, a poorly understood freedom of spirit.</p>

<p>The remedy is always humility and sincerity. Speak about it in spiritual direction.</p>

<p>These are some of the areas where the enemy can attack: trying to promote a critical spirit or a judgmental spirit, a lack of docility.</p>

<p>Obedience is not against our freedom.</p>

<p>I heard a canon lawyer many years ago, shortly after the new Code of Canon Law was promoted in 1983.</p>

<p>He was saying that in our society, law is almost a dirty word. We have to improve the public opinion of the law. Everybody wants to be out from underneath the yoke of the law.</p>

<p>He talked about the relationship between law and freedom. He said in every city, the airport is about half an hour from the center of the city. Everyone is free to go to the airport. Everyone has a right to go to the airport.</p>

<p>To go to the airport, you’ve got to go down one road, turn left here, turn right there, go around the roundabout. Maybe around another roundabout. Eventually, you turn left, and you get to the airport.</p>

<p>But he said if you take away all the laws, and you tell people that now if they don’t want to drive on the left side of the road, they can drive on the right side of the road. And when they come to the roundabout, instead of going clockwise, if they feel like it, they’re free to go anticlockwise. And if they want to drive to the airport all the way on the footpath, they can do so. And if they want to have fun, they could reverse to the airport on the wrong side of the road.</p>

<p>What would be the result? The result would be chaos. Instead of taking half an hour to get to the airport, you might never get to the airport.</p>

<p>It might take you hours and hours, because if everybody else is reversing all the way to where they’re going on the wrong side of the road, you may have a monumental traffic jam.</p>

<p>The moral of the story is that the opposite of law is not freedom; it’s chaos.</p>

<p>Freedom comes with the law. We maintain our freedom by following the law.</p>

<p>This is a very important Christian concept, not just in society in general, but in the family, in any organization, in a school, in the workplace, in the university.</p>

<p>We maintain our freedom by following the laws or the indications that are laid down to preserve everybody else’s freedom.</p>

<p>Through this virtue, we show that our self-surrender to God is real; that our love is effective; that our faith is high-quality faith; and that our intention is upright.</p>

<p>I haven’t come just to do my will, what I think is best, what I want to do. I’ve come to do what God wants me to do.</p>

<p>Therefore, obedience and things may be difficult or costly, and can demand a lot of fortitude, and possibly a lot of sacrifice. But sacrifice is the touchstone of love.</p>

<p>“Greater love than this, no man has, than to lay down his life for his friends” (John 15:13).</p>

<p>To subject our will to another in a regular way can be heroic: to our spouse, to our boss, to the law, to the organization. We have to ardently desire to do the will of the Father at all times.</p>

<p>We find that the fullness of obedience is found on Calvary. The whole of the Redemption is the fruit of the obedience of Christ.</p>

<p>“For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, by one Man’s obedience many will be made righteous,” says St. Paul to the Romans (Rom. 5:19).</p>

<p>A very good aspiration or word to have on our lips occasionally is the word <em>serviam,</em> I will serve.</p>

<p>I’ve come to serve God in my family, in my workplace, in public life, in and through the individuals that God has placed around me; to serve my children; to serve my neighbors.</p>

<p>The obedience of the children of God reflects our identity with Christ. We are children of His, with the same obedience that He has.</p>

<p>The more we go along in our Christian vocation, then the more refined our obedience should be. It’s not that as we get older, we impose our will more on other people.</p>

<p>Our Lord lived obedience to the end: “obedience until death” (<em>cf</em>. Phil. 2:8). Christ is always present in obedience.</p>

<p>If we have difficulty obeying, it can be an opportunity to grow in humility.</p>

<p>Blessed Álvaro del Portillo used to say that availability is one of the signs of those people who deal constantly with the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>We have an ongoing relationship with the Holy Spirit when we find it easy to do things. Can you do this? Can you do that? Can you come here? Can you go there?</p>

<p>In principle, yes, because I have come to serve. That’s what my life is all about in this marriage, in this family, in this organization.</p>

<p>We can’t be co-redeemers without obeying. This virtue confers a supernatural value to the whole of our life.</p>

<p>The need to obey doesn’t depend exclusively on the good it does to the soul nor on the requirements of organizational efficacy, but on its intimate union with the Redemption. It’s an intimate part of the mystery of the Cross.</p>

<p>In <em>Lumen gentium</em> of the Second Vatican Council, it says, “To carry out the will of the Father, Christ inaugurated the Kingdom of heaven on earth and revealed to us the mystery of that kingdom” (Vatican II, <em>Lumen gentium</em>, Point 3, November 21, 1964).</p>

<p>For us to imitate Christ and to be co-redeemers, we need to obey. If we set limits to our obedience, we reduce our union with Christ.</p>

<p>We haven’t come to impose our personal criteria. We have to decide to become a saint because that’s what our Christian vocation is all about, and that equates with submitting ourselves or lowering ourselves, emptying ourselves.</p>

<p>This virtue allows us to cut off many deviations of our will at the beginning.</p>

<p>“It happened that on the eighth day, they came to circumcise the child; they were going to call him Zechariah after his father, but his mother spoke up: ‘No, he is to be called John.’ They said to her, ‘But no one in your family has that name,’ and they made signs to his father to find out what he wanted him called. His father asked for a writing tablet and wrote, ‘His name is John.’ And they were all astonished. At that instant, his power of speech returned and he spoke and praised God” (Luke 1:59-64).</p>

<p>Only the person who has learned how to obey is capable of commanding, because they’ve discovered that the intimate sense of obedience is love, and that the mission of governance is also an act of love, part of the full and unique love that stirs souls of all who serve the Church.</p>

<p>St. Josemaría used to say that the task of governance anywhere in the Church is another opportunity to serve, and to cease holding some position of governance is not a failure, but another way of serving.</p>

<p>“Whatever our task,” says St. Paul to the Colossians, “work heartily, as serving the Lord and not men. … You are serving the Lord Jesus Christ” (Col. 3:23-24).</p>

<p>Precisely because we live and work in the world, we have to try to obey with more zeal and exactitude at whatever is asked of us.</p>

<p>No one in the world should make themselves untouchable, no matter how important our professional work may be, because “our food has to be to do the will of him who sent me” (<em>cf</em>. John 4:34).</p>

<p>This is what gives meaning and strength to my life: to do God’s will even in the smallest things, not in doing my preferences or my caprices.</p>

<p>This virtue is the touchstone of humility: humility put into practice, of supernatural meaning that animates us. It gives us the assurance that we are truly serving God, and not our vanity, our caprice, or our selfishness.</p>

<p>We also have to try and be obedient to the advice we receive in spiritual direction.</p>

<p>Our Lord told the lepers to go and show themselves to the priests (Luke 17:14). He didn’t cleanse them there and then. He wanted their response of obedience.</p>

<p>The blind man washes his clay-filled eyes in the pool of Siloam, and then he begins to see (John 9:7).</p>

<p>The superabundant catch of fish comes from lowering the net to the other side of the boat (Luke 5:4-6).</p>

<p>Many miracles occur after the exercise of this virtue.</p>

<p>Our obedience may sometimes require the cheerful rearrangement of our personal plans. Instead of your plan, can you change your plan and do this or do that, or pass by here or pick up this thing? This is what makes us free to be fruitful, and this is the way that we love.</p>

<p>We can ask Our Lord to make us personally responsible for the things that we do: obedience to the Church; obedience to the Holy Father; being docile and allowing the image of Christ to be forged in us; letting God act in us and through us.</p>

<p>Identifying ourselves with Christ means being obedient in everything. I don’t decide to obey the Church in this, this, and this, but not in that, that, and that.</p>

<p>I’m not a cafeteria Catholic, that I pick and choose what I want to obey. It’s a very safe thing always to obey what the Church tells us.</p>

<p>In the <em>Furrow</em>, Point 374, it says, “Obey with your lips, with your heart, and your mind. —It is not a man who is being obeyed, but God.”</p>

<p>It helps us to be very supernatural. The spirit of service in the world can come to have greater importance when it seems that nobody wants to obey.</p>

<p>In the <em>Furrow</em>, Point 381, it says, “When will you be convinced that you have to obey? And you disobey if, instead of fulfilling your plan of life, you waste your time. You have to fill every minute with work, study, and interior life.”</p>

<p>Other people may be watching and learning from your self-giving.</p>

<p>We can turn to Our Lady, who “kept all these things carefully in her heart” (Luke 2:19,51).</p>

<p>In the <em>Furrow</em>, Point 415, it says, “Discipline does not seem at all heavy when it goes together with a clean and sincere love. Even if it costs you a lot, it unites you to the Loved One.”</p>

<p>“‘Did you not know that I must be about my Father’s business?’ And they did not understand the things he said to them” (Luke 2:49-50).</p>

<p>There were things that Mary and Joseph did not understand, but yet they obeyed.</p>

<p>Mary, may you teach us to have a greater, more refined obedience in all the things that we do.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

Conor Donnelly</p>

<p>(<em>Proofread</em>)</p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>It’s customary for saints to be outstanding and to become well known for some particular virtue or aspect of their struggle which makes them conspicuous exemplars for the faithful.</p>

<p>For example, St. Francis of Assisi is revered for his heroic love of poverty. The Holy Curé of Ars is a model of extraordinary priestly service to souls. St. Thomas More is remembered for his devotion to both God and country, but to God first, even at the price of martyrdom.</p>

<p>In the case of St. Joseph, we have only to dwell upon the words of St. Matthew: “Joseph, the husband of Mary” (Matt. 1:16). Here we have the summary of Joseph’s vocation and the setting for his sanctity.</p>

<p>With the exception of Jesus, no one ever cared for Our Lady more than St. Joseph did. No one protected her with more vigilance. No one has ever given his life to the Lord with such total generosity as the Holy Patriarch did.</p>

<p>God’s loving providence ordained that Jesus would be born into a human family. Joseph was not only the guardian of Mary; he was also her husband.</p>

<p>According to Jewish custom of the time, matrimony involved two distinct ceremonies separated by a period of time: betrothal and the formal wedding.</p>

<p>In the ceremony of betrothal, the spouses made a firm promise as regards their future wedding and matrimonial union. The bridegroom would place the rings in the hands of the future bride and both would receive a blessing. From that moment on, the woman would be known as the wife of so-and-so.</p>

<p>The normal interval between betrothal and the wedding ceremony was about the space of a year. It was within that period that Our Lady received the news of her vocation from the angel Gabriel, and that the Incarnation took place. At the same time, St. Joseph learned about God’s plans through a dream. We’re told in St. Matthew, “So Joseph, arising from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him, and took unto him his wife” (Matt. 1:24).</p>

<p>“He took Mary as his wife,” we’re told by John Paul II, “in humble acceptance of the mystery of her maternity. He accepted her along with her Son who would come to the world by the action of the Holy Spirit. St. Joseph can therefore be compared to Our Lady in his great docility to the will of God as revealed to him by the angel” (John Paul II, Apostolic Exhortation, <em>Redemptoris custos</em>, Point 3, August 15, 1989).</p>

<p>The wedding ceremony was the fulfillment of the marital contract entered into at betrothal. It was customary for the bride to be brought to the home of the bridegroom amid great rejoicing (Franz Michel Willam, <em>Life of Mary</em>). In this manner, the union was validated before the entire community, and, therefore, her offspring would be recognized as legitimate.</p>

<p>It is of the essence of the marital union that the spouses give their bodies to one another. Because the marriage of Mary and Joseph was an authentic marriage, these reciprocal rights existed in their union. Because of what they had learned from God, by mutual agreement, Mary and Joseph had renounced the exercise of these rights. The denial of them would have been a cause for annulment.</p>

<p>St. Augustine says that in the case of Joseph and Mary, however, we have something different because here we have a case of mutual voluntary renunciation. This understanding was the fruit of a most refined, prayerful environment.</p>

<p>We can get some understanding of this union if we look upon it and try to comprehend it with a clean heart. Joseph became a virgin for the sake of the Virgin. He protected her with great refinement and affection (Augustine, <em>Of Holy Virginity</em>).</p>

<p>St. Thomas gives various reasons for the appropriateness of the Virgin’s being united to Joseph in true matrimony (Thomas Aquinas, <em>Summa Theologiae</em>, Part III, Question 29). It was appropriate and necessary so that Mary’s pregnancy would not be a cause of scandal among relatives and neighbors.</p>

<p>It was useful that Jesus would be born into a human family as an apparently legitimate son, since no one would thus know of the mystery of His supernatural conception. It was helpful that Jesus and Mary would find support for Mother and Child in their life with St. Joseph. In this way, the arrival of the Messiah would also be hidden from the devil.</p>

<p>With this union Mary gives due honor both to the state of matrimony and virginity. Our Lady loved Joseph with a deep and pure love. She knew and understood him well, and she wants us to go to him for assistance.</p>

<p>Joseph and Mary are the model husband and wife. They are the perfect image of total self-giving to God with an undivided heart, in either apostolic celibacy or virginity lived in the middle of the world.</p>

<p>St. John Paul says, “Virginity or celibacy for the sake of the Kingdom of God not only does not contradict the dignity of marriage but presupposes it and confirms it. Marriage and virginity or celibacy are two ways of expressing and living the one mystery of the covenant of God with his people” (John Paul II, Apostolic Exhortation, <em>Familiaris consortio</em>, Point 16, December 22, 1981).</p>

<p>Joseph and Mary were married in Nazareth, and here in this little village, the Word became flesh. In the wedding ceremony, Mary would receive a small dowry as was customary. It would consist of a jewel of modest value, clothing, and furniture. Perhaps she would have received a patrimony of some land.</p>

<p>In any event, all this did not add up to very much. But when someone is poor, gifts of little worth take on an enhanced value. Since Joseph was a carpenter, he would have built the best furniture possible for their home. The news of the wedding must have passed from one town to another: ‘Mary has married Joseph the carpenter.’</p>

<p>Our Lady wanted these ceremonies to take place even though she had given herself completely to God. “Marriage to a man like Joseph gave her security and tranquility” (Marie-Joseph Lagrange, <em>The Gospel of Jesus Christ</em>).</p>

<p>Joseph and Mary allowed themselves to be led by divine inspiration. We can apply to this holy couple the following truth taught by St. Thomas: “It is natural and typical that the just find in all their works inspiration from the Holy Spirit” (<em>cf</em>. Thomas Aquinas, <em>Summa Theologiae</em>, Part III, Question 36).</p>

<p>God was attentive to the human love between Joseph and Mary. He supplied abundant graces to strengthen that devotion.</p>

<p>Joseph eventually came to understand that Our Lady’s Child was from the Holy Spirit and that she was to be the Mother of the Redeemer. As a consequence, he would have loved Our Lady more than ever.</p>

<p>One writer said, “Joseph loved Our Lady, not with a brotherly love but with a conjugal love. It was so deep that any carnal relation was made totally superfluous. So refined was it that he became not only a witness of Mary’s virginal purity—virgin before birth, in birth, and after birth as the Church teaches us—but he became its custodian” (Federico Suarez, <em>Joseph of Nazareth</em>). God the Father took the greatest care to prepare this virginal family for His only-begotten Son.</p>

<p>Painters have traditionally depicted Joseph as an elderly man in order to emphasize the perpetual virginity of Mary. But it’s more likely that Joseph was not much older than his wife.</p>

<p>“You don’t have to wait to be old or lifeless to practice the virtue of chastity. Purity comes from love; and the strength and joy of youth are no obstacle for noble love. Joseph had a young heart and a young body when he married Mary, when he learned of the mystery of her divine motherhood, when he lived in her company,” said St. Josemaría, “respecting the integrity God wished to give the world as one more sign that he had come to share the life of his creatures” (Josemaría Escrivá, <em>Christ Is Passing By</em>, Point 40).</p>

<p>We can ask the Holy Patriarch to teach us how to live this kind of love in the circumstances in which God has called us. We want this love “that lights up the [heart]” (T. Aquinas, <em>On Charity</em>) so that we may perform our ordinary work with joy.</p>

<p>In the Gospels, St. Joseph is repeatedly referred to as “father” (Luke 2:27,33,41,48). Without a doubt, this is how Jesus called the Holy Patriarch in the intimacy of their home in Nazareth.</p>

<p>We’re told in St. Luke that Jesus was known in the community as the “son of Joseph” (Luke 3:23). Joseph certainly fulfilled the duties corresponding to those of a father in the Holy Family.</p>

<p>He gave Jesus His name. He led the Holy Family into Egypt. He decided where they were to live on their return to Palestine. Jesus obeyed Joseph as if he were His natural father: “And he went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them” (Luke 2:51).</p>

<p>Jesus was conceived in a miraculous way by the action of the Holy Spirit. He was born from the virginal womb of Mary according to the divine Will.</p>

<p>One writer says God wanted to be born within a family, to be raised by a father and mother. Just as God chose Mary to be His Mother, God chose Joseph from among all men to be His father (<em>cf</em>. Jose Antonio of the Child Jesus, <em>St. Joseph</em>).</p>

<p>St. Joseph behaved and felt like a father towards Jesus. He had an ardent love for the Son of God and for the Mother of God. This love was even greater than the natural love a natural father may have for his natural son. This is because Joseph cared for Jesus as a son and at the same time worshipped Him as his God.</p>

<p>He was greatly moved at the sight of a God who would give Himself so generously for the good of mankind. This amazing spectacle caused Joseph to love Jesus in an ever-increasing way.</p>

<p>Joseph loved Jesus almost as if he had really begotten Him. He looked upon Jesus as a wondrous gift that God had bestowed on him in his ordinary human life.</p>

<p>Joseph consecrated his energies, his time, his greatest concern, his care to this gift. He sought no compensation other than the opportunity to give more of himself. His love was strong and sweet, tranquil and fervent, emotional and tender.</p>

<p>One writer said, “We can think of Joseph with Jesus in his arms, teaching the child songs, watching over his sleep, making Him little toys, treating the child with the affection shown by any parent” (<em>cf</em>. Michael Gasnier, <em>Joseph the Silent</em>).</p>

<p>Joseph must have been humbled at the awesome thought that the Son of God also wanted to be his son. In our prayer today, we can ask the Holy Patriarch to teach us how to love and cherish Jesus as he himself did.</p>

<p>“Popular trust in St. Joseph is seen in the expression ‘Go to Joseph,’ which reminds us of the famine in Egypt when the Egyptians begged Pharaoh for bread. He in turn replied, ‘Go to Joseph; what he says to you, do’ (Gen. 41:55).</p>

<p>“Pharaoh was referring to Joseph the son of Jacob, who was sold into slavery because of the jealousy of his brothers (<em>cf</em>. Gen. 37:11-28), and who—according to the biblical account— subsequently became Viceroy of Egypt (<em>cf</em>. Gen. 41:41-44).</p>

<p>“As a descendant of David (<em>cf</em>. Matt. 1:16-20), from whose stock Jesus was to spring according to the promise made to David by the prophet Nathan (<em>cf</em>. 2 Sam 7), and as the spouse of Mary of Nazareth, St. Joseph stands at the crossroads between the Old and New Testaments” (Pope Francis, Apostolic Letter, <em>Patris corde</em>, Point 1, December 8, 2020).</p>

<p>“If the first stage of all true interior healing is to accept our personal history and embrace even the things in life that we did not choose, we need now also to add another important element: creative courage.</p>

<p>“This emerges especially in the way we deal with difficulties. In the face of difficulty, we can either give up and walk away, or somehow engage with it. At times, difficulties bring out resources we did not even think we had.</p>

<p>“As we read the infancy narratives, we may often wonder why God did not act in a more direct and clear way. Yet God acts through events and people. Joseph was the man chosen by God to guide the beginnings of the history of redemption. He was the true ‘miracle’ by which God saves the child and his mother. God acted by trusting in Joseph’s creative courage.</p>

<p>“Arriving in Bethlehem and finding no lodging where Mary could give birth, Joseph took a stable and, as best he could, turned it into a welcoming home for the Son of God coming into the world (<em>cf</em>. Luke 2:6-7). Faced with imminent danger from Herod, who wanted to kill the child, Joseph was warned once again in a dream to protect the child, and rose in the middle of the night to prepare the flight into Egypt (<em>cf</em>. Matt. 2:13-14).</p>

<p>“A superficial reading of these stories can often give the impression that the world is at the mercy of the strong and mighty, but the ‘good news’ of the Gospel consists in showing that, for all the arrogance and violence of worldly powers, God always finds a way to carry out his saving plan. So too, our lives may at times seem to be at the mercy of the powerful, but the Gospel shows us what counts. God always finds a way to save us, provided we show the same creative courage as the carpenter of Nazareth, who was able to turn a problem into a possibility by trusting always in divine providence.</p>

<p>“If at times God seems not to help us, [surely] this does not mean that we have been abandoned, but instead are being trusted to plan, to be creative, and to find solutions ourselves.</p>

<p>“That kind of creative courage was shown by the friends of the paralytic, who lowered him from the roof in order to bring him to Jesus when they couldn’t access him by any other means because of the crowd (<em>cf</em>. Luke 5:17-26). Difficulties did not stand in the way of those friends’ boldness and persistence. They were convinced that Jesus could heal the man, and ‘finding no way to bring him in because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down with his bed through the tiles into the middle of the crowd in front of Jesus” (Pope Francis, <em>ibid</em>., Point 5).</p>

<p>They were full of initiative and daring. They vandalized the roof in order to get their friend to Jesus.</p>

<p>“When he saw their faith, he said, ‘Friend, your sins are forgiven you’ (Luke 5:20). Jesus recognized the creative faith with which they sought to bring their sick friend to him.</p>

<p>“The Gospel does not tell us how long Our Lady, St. Joseph, and the child remained in Egypt. But certainly they would have needed to eat, to find a home, and employment. It does not take much imagination to fill in those details. The Holy Family had to face concrete problems like every other family, like so many of our migrant brothers and sisters who today risk their lives to escape misfortune and hunger.” We can consider “St. Joseph as the special patron of all those forced to leave their native lands because of war, hatred, persecution, and poverty.</p>

<p>“At the end of every account in which Joseph plays a role, the Gospel tells us that he gets up, takes the child and his mother, and does what God commanded him (<em>cf</em>. Matt. 1:24; 2:14,21). Jesus and Our Lady his Mother are the most precious treasure of our faith.</p>

<p>“In the divine plan of salvation, the Son is inseparable from his Mother, from Mary, who ‘advanced, in her pilgrimage of faith, and faithfully persevered in her union with her Son until she stood at the cross’ (Vatican II, <em>Lumen gentium</em>, Point 58, November 21, 1964).</p>

<p>“We should always consider whether we ourselves are protecting Jesus and Mary, for they are mysteriously entrusted to our responsibility, care, and safekeeping.</p>

<p>“The Son of the Almighty came into our world in a state of great vulnerability. He needed to be defended, protected, cared for, and raised by Joseph. God trusted Joseph, as did Mary, who found in him someone who would not only save her life, but would always provide for her and her child.</p>

<p>“In this sense, St. Joseph could not be other than the Guardian of the Church, because the Church is the continuation of the Body of Christ in history, even as Mary’s motherhood is reflected in the motherhood of the Church (<em>Catechism of the Catholic Church</em>, Point 963-970).</p>

<p>“In his continued protection of the Church, Joseph continues to protect the child and his mother, and we too, by our love for the Church, continue to love the child and his mother.</p>

<p>“That child would go on to say, ‘As you did it to one of the least of these who are members of my family, you did it to me’ (Matt. 25:40). Consequently, every poor, needy, suffering, or dying person, every stranger, every prisoner, every infirm person is ‘the child’ whom Joseph continues to protect.</p>

<p>“For this reason, St. Joseph is invoked as protector of the unfortunate, the needy, exiles, the afflicted, the poor, and the dying. Consequently, the Church cannot fail to show a special love for the least of our brothers and sisters, for Jesus showed a particular concern for them and personally identified with them.</p>

<p>“From St. Joseph, we have to learn that same care and responsibility. We have to learn to love the child and his mother, to love the sacraments and charity, to love the Church and the poor. Each of these realities is always the child and his mother” (<em>ibid</em>., Point 5).</p>

<p>Joseph does not resign himself passively, but he takes the initiative and he puts his optimism and cheerfulness into play. He can be a great example for us of <em>beginning again</em> in all sorts of situations.</p>

<p>He can teach us that we’ll win fighting. He can help us to have a warlike mentality. From his example, we can have the assurance of permanence and perseverance in the hardest of battles without giving in, without getting tired.</p>

<p>The obstacles in the course of our life, in our marriage, in our work, in our health, in our finances, the difficulties, the contradictions which without doubt exist, far from disturbing our path towards victory or making us feel nostalgic for some comfort, can make us stronger and more determined. Those things can lift us up onto a new plane.</p>

<p>St. Augustine liked to say, “There is no soul who works for God who does not grow when faced with difficulties.” The difficulties form part of the reality on which our life is built. We live and work in real situations, not Disneyland. We need to be strong people, sons and daughters of God.</p>

<p>We can ask Our Lord in our prayer to help us to take advantage of the big and small challenges of every day, to grow in faith, hope, and love like St. Joseph did.</p>

<p>A Chinese proverb says, “A gem cannot be polished without friction, nor a man made perfect without trials.” We have the help of grace. Nothing should be able to shift us from our place in the battle.</p>

<p>If at times we can’t see properly, then we should let ourselves be guided by those with the grace of state. If the struggle is uphill, we don’t abandon the attack, we continue working. The sacrifice must be a holocaust.</p>

<p>We have to try and put that interior toughness into practice: eating everything that’s placed in front of us, teaching children to do the same, realizing, as one educationalist in the States says, that “no is also a loving word” (James Stenson, Conference Talk, <em>Educating in Virtue</em>, May 1996).</p>

<p>Children learn backbone by example. We need to be demanding on ourselves in order to be demanding on them—in work, in detachment, in chastity, in practicing temperance and sobriety in the home in relation to television, or movies, or spending money, or holidays, or luxuries, or comforts.</p>

<p>“Courage is simply the willingness to be afraid but to act anyway” (Robert Anthony, <em>Beyond Positive Thinking</em>). In the course of our life, very likely there’s something to which God is calling us to do that may scare us to death. We can ask St. Joseph that we could have the courage that we need to act anyway.</p>

<p>“There are many good reasons,” we’re told in <em>The Forge</em>, “to honor St. Joseph, and to learn from his life. He was a man of strong faith. He earned a living for his family—Jesus and Mary—with his own hard work. He guarded the purity of the Blessed Virgin, who was his Spouse. And he respected—he loved!—God’s freedom when God made his choice: not only his choice of Our Lady the Virgin as his Mother, but also the choice of St. Joseph as the husband of Our Lady” (J. Escrivá, <em>The Forge</em>, Point 552).</p>

<p>We can finish our prayer turning to Our Lady and ask her that she might help us to be more conscious of St. Joseph as we go about our daily tasks, to live a presence of him, and to truly put that phrase “Go to Joseph” into practice as we move through our ordinary day.</p>

<p><em>I thank you my God for the good resolutions, affections, and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, St. Joseph my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p>(<em>Proofread</em>)</p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em><br />
<br />
In the Entrance Antiphon of today’s Mass, we read, “Sing psalms and hymns and inspired songs among yourselves, singing and chanting to the Lord in your hearts” (Eph. 5:19).</p>

<p>Today, the 14th of February, is a day of celebration and of thanksgiving in Opus Dei for all of the graces that God has given to us.</p>

<p>As we realize another year has passed, a year of our vocation, a year of the history of the Work on the earth, another year of the fulfillment of God’s plans, of how He’s using His Work to do all sorts of wonderful things in us and through us.</p>

<p>Our Father said, “Always be giving thanks to God constantly for everything: for what seems good and for what seems bad, for what is sweet and for what is bitter, for the white and for the black, for small things and for big things, for what seems meager and for what seems bountiful, for what is temporal and for what reaches unto eternity (J. Escrivá, <em>Notes</em>, December 25, 1972).</p>

<p>We all have great reasons to give thanks to God for the women of the Prelature and also for the Priestly Society of the Holy Cross, whose founding we also celebrate today: very special gifts that God has given to His Work. He crowned them in a special way.</p>

<p>Don Álvaro, on the 60th anniversary of the founding of the women of the Prelature, wrote that on the 14th of February 1930, Our Lord wanted to offer our Father a tangible proof of the divinity of the Work.</p>

<p>Before that date, as we all know, our Founder was very sure that there would not be women in Opus Dei. He told us on more than one occasion, “I had written down, because of the difference between Opus Dei and another institution that existed outside of Spain, that we would never work with women.”</p>

<p>This must have been, he said, around 1929. “Shortly afterwards, on the 14th of February 1930, I was celebrating Mass in the house of an elderly lady, when the women of the Prelature came to the world.”</p>

<p>Don Álvaro continues, “It was a super clear, supernatural light which our Founder received in the Mass, after Communion, on that Friday, 14th of February 1930. As always, when Our Lord manifested His will to him in an extraordinary way, in the first moments, his first reaction was that of feeling a bit disturbed. Then he perceived in the intimacy of his being, those words of Our Lord to Our Lady: ‘Do not be afraid’ (Luke 2:10). And he remained full of peace.”</p>

<p>He began, as he did in 1928 with men, to work apostolically, particularly from the confessional box, with the women and young girls who came to seek his advice.</p>

<p>With great thanksgiving and gratitude to Our Lord, He liked to remember the help that a sister of ours gave him who was taken up with great pain from a great illness. She offered this treasure of her sufferings for this divine enterprise.</p>

<p>When we go back and hear the words of Don Álvaro speaking about the beginnings, we can make a great act of faith, and also of thanksgiving, because we see how God has acted in the world, and very particularly, how He acted in the life of our Father.</p>

<p>When we look around at the reality of Opus Dei, what it is in the world today, it’s a very different phenomenon to what was there in 1930. There was almost nothing. Yet because of our Father’s correspondence, his holiness, his humility, that spirit of Opus Dei has spread all over the world.</p>

<p>Everything that our Father has done and everything that he has written has great relevance for us. God speaks to us through his life and through his correspondence, beckoning us, calling us, encouraging us to walk in the footsteps of our Father, as the pathway that Our Lord has laid out for us in order that we might know Him and love Him.</p>

<p>When the Confessor of our Father heard about this new manifestation of the will of God, without intervening in any way in the organization of the Work, he confirmed to our Father with great sureness that “this is just as much from God as the rest.”</p>

<p>Don Álvaro continues, “Look at how Our Lord works. He loves us with all of His goodness. He takes care of us with the refined diligence. He gathers us up with His immense mercy. He never leaves us alone. Even more, He always reaches out with a hand to us.</p>

<p>“Fill yourself with joy, my daughter, my son, because this God of ours, omnipotent and eternal, speaks to us constantly in the silence of our prayer. And we know His voice, also in moments of dryness, because if we are ready and open, as our Father was, to put into practice what Our Lord asks of us, even though we have to go against the grain, He gives us that unequivocal sign of interior peace.”</p>

<p>We can thank God also for that peace that we have in our vocation, in our life, in the means of formation, in our own personal apostolate, in the bringing forward of all the apostolic works, in taking on our shoulders the economic responsibility for all of this great apostolic work that God wants us to do, so that we take our vocation very seriously, we are willing to carry the cross, because we know God will fill us with His interior peace.</p>

<p>“He also speaks to us,” said Don Álvaro, “through other people in spiritual direction. It was Our Lord who spoke to each one of us at the beginning of our vocation, when somebody opened up for us this joyful horizon so that we would give ourselves to the Work. Later on, we count on that blessed personal experience. Our Lord continues to reach out His hand to us all along our pathway until our final pilgrimage on this earth, making use also of spiritual direction to show His will to us.”</p>

<p>There is a conclusion from all of this, and that is that in our interior life, we have to have initiative. Initiative, but at the same time we don’t direct ourselves. Our apostolate is a directed apostolate. We need that obedience, that docility, from those who are there to guide us.</p>

<p>We have this great treasure of the spirit of Opus Dei in our hands. There are aspects of our Father’s life that we are discovering and rediscovering all the time, every time that we read some of his writings, or we discover something new about his life, or the new things that people are writing about him.</p>

<p>One of the ideas that is worth thinking about is that our Father was one of the greatest Christian feminists of the 20th century. Possibly nobody in the history of the Church has done as much for women in the world as our Father has done.</p>

<p>He encouraged women to use their talents to the full in all fields of human endeavor: in business, in politics, in medicine, in engineering, in the home, in science, in all sorts of areas. He wrote very dramatic things about the role of women in society that in many ways were ahead of their time.</p>

<p>In <em>Conversations</em> he says, “The development, maturity, emancipation of women should not mean a pretension to equality, to uniformity with men, a servile imitation of a man’s way of doing things. That would not get us anywhere. Women would turn out losers, not because they’re better than men or worse, but because they’re different.”</p>

<p>He liked to outline these particular characteristics of women and the great talents that they bring to any enterprise. He said, “Women, like men, possess the dignity of being persons and children of God. … They’re called to bring to the family, to society, and to the Church, characteristics which are their own and which they alone can give: their gentle warmth and untiring generosity, their love for detail, their quick-wittedness and intuition, their simple and deep piety, their constancy” (J. Escrivá, <em>Conversations</em>, Point 87).</p>

<p>Pope St. John Paul liked to say that every man coming into the world is entrusted to the care of a woman (John Paul II, Apostolic Letter, <em>Mulieris dignitatem</em>, Point 30, August 15, 1988).</p>

<p>He liked to say that while both parents play a role, it’s the woman in particular that teaches the man what it means to be human. Ultimately, she teaches him what it means to love, and then this is his greatest maturity.</p>

<p>One American educationalist says that every baby coming into the world comes into the world like a self-satisfying, hedonistic gorilla. The role of parents is to turn that hedonistic, self-satisfying gorilla into an adult.</p>

<p>The little baby screams for its milk. ‘Give me my milk, and even if it’s three in the morning, get up out of bed and give me my milk because I am the most important person in the world. And I’m going to scream and scream and scream until I get it.’ The role of parents is to turn this little gorilla into an adult.</p>

<p>He says that adults are not just people who can take care of themselves, because a dog or a cat or a hothouse plant can do that. An adult is somebody who fundamentally can take care of others. An adult is somebody who can forget about themselves.</p>

<p>That’s what love is. That’s why some people never become adults, because love is sacrifice. The mother has sacrificed herself for her child. She, more than the father, teaches that lesson to the child: what love is, how to forget about yourself, how to give yourself to others.</p>

<p>He continues in <em>Conversations</em>, “It is not only outside the home that a woman achieves her perfection, as though time spent at home was time stolen from the development of her personality. … The attention given to her family will always be a woman’s greatest dignity. In the care she takes of her husband and children...in her work of creating a warm and formative atmosphere around her, a woman fulfills the most indispensable part of her mission. It follows that she can achieve her personal perfection here” (<em>ibid</em>.).</p>

<p>While encouraging women to take their place in the world, to go as far as they can, to use all their talents, to play a great role in society, he also emphasizes the fundamental role that a woman plays in the family, in the home—of forming new human beings, of making that home and that family a school of deeper humanity, a school of virtue, a school of piety, the domestic Church.</p>

<p>He continues, “In all spheres, women have their own valuable contribution...which will be rendered to the extent that they are humanly and professionally equipped. Both family and society clearly need this special contribution, which is in no way secondary to that of men.”</p>

<p>We can think of all the great ways that the Catholic Church has promoted the authentic development of women all over the world through our history—the great education orders that have educated girls in every last part of the globe, the healthcare orders who took care of the sick in all sorts of ways, giving great example,</p>

<p>The Church has always promoted the care and education of women as much as possible. But St. Josemaría has sort of brought it to a different level. Their great contribution will be “insofar as they are humanly and professionally equipped.” He encourages women to go as far as they can, to be experts in various fields.</p>

<p>“The essential equality with men and women,” he says, “demands an understanding of the complementary roles which they play in the Church’s growth and in the progress of society” (<em>Conversations</em>, Point 14).</p>

<p>In marriage a man does not complete a woman or the woman does not complete a man. They are already complete in themselves. They complement each other.</p>

<p>“Not in vain,” he says, “did God make them man and woman. This diversity should be considered not in a ‘patriarchal’ sense but in its full, rich depth of tones and consequences” (<em>ibid</em>.).</p>

<p>Diversity is something good. It’s willed by God, something we have to foster. God created the male and female. The male should be more male and the female should be more female.</p>

<p>“In this way,” he continues, “men are freed from the temptation of ‘masculinizing’ the Church and society, and women from seeing their mission in the People of God and in the world as no more than showing that they can do equally well the tasks which were formerly reserved to men. I think that both men and women should rightly consider themselves as the protagonists in the history of salvation, but each complementing the work of the other” (<em>ibid</em>.).</p>

<p>I was on a plane a few years ago and there was a young couple with their young baby. I couldn’t help noticing how the mother was looking after the baby very well and keeping him happy.</p>

<p>Then, after a little while she passed the baby to the father. You could sort of see this young father—he did his best, he did what he could. But his way of carrying the baby, looking after the baby, and trying to satisfy the needs of the baby, compared to the mother, was just inadequate.</p>

<p>It was almost amusing to see. In spite of his best efforts, he really couldn’t hack it. In that little moment or two, you could see the difference in the quality of the talents of each individual person. We all have a different role to play.</p>

<p>When we look at the seeds that St. Josemaría has sown in the world by the will of God with the women of the Prelature, we could think, on this feast day—as we begin to look towards the hundredth anniversary that is coming up in a few years, which the Father has encouraged us to focus on—we could think of all the wonderful horizons that are opening up in front of us.</p>

<p>As the Prelate likes to tell us, we have to think back of the early people who went to each country to start the work. There’s a book about the first women who went to Japan. They left Rome. Their boat got as far as—I think it was Aden or Suez or someplace—and they found a letter waiting for them there from our Father.</p>

<p>He followed them every step of the journey. He sent these daughters of his to faraway places to plant that seed. He took great care that the seed would find good soil.</p>

<p>When we look back and see how the women of the Prelature have developed in every country, we see this great divine enterprise from a different perspective.</p>

<p>But then also we have to see how that same faith that our Father had in sending out those sisters of ours, and they themselves, who gave themselves so completely—we have to try and have the same dispositions in our apostolate, as we also “launch out into the deep” (Luke 5:4).</p>

<p>In 1988, on the 60th anniversary of the founding of the men of the Prelature, Don Álvaro talked about the spirit of the beginnings.</p>

<p>He said, “This 60th anniversary is an excellent occasion that Our Lord gives us to remind ourselves that we always have to go forward with the stimulating spirit full of the novelty of the beginnings, that spirit with which our Founder started the Work on the 2nd of October 1928, to carry out the task that God was entrusting to him, that made him the happiest person in the world because of the confidence that Our Father in heaven gave him.”</p>

<p>Each one of us is called to “launch out into the deep,” to see the new horizons of apostolate that God is placing before us, new people that we get to meet, new possibilities.</p>

<p>The pandemic, social media, there are all sorts of new means for transmitting the message of the Gospel. There are new people who are hungry to hear these things. We have to look to the future.</p>

<p>Recently, Pope Francis has talked about how there is a great spiritual emptiness in the world (Pope Francis, Apostolic Exhortation, <em>Querida Amazonia</em>, Point 108, February 2, 2020; <em>Angelus</em>, June 19, 2016).</p>

<p>Our Father would like to say this is our world. This moment of history—it is the world that God has entrusted to us.</p>

<p>He wants us to fill that spiritual emptiness with all the good things that we have to give, with the apostolate of apostolates, with the care of our homes and of our family, with all sorts of details of taste and elegance—often unconscious details that transmit a great refinement and transmit the message of the dignity of every human person.</p>

<p>Our Father has said that every corner of the homes of every supernumerary, every cooperator, has to become a corner of the home in Nazareth. It is our job to make that happen.</p>

<p>Each one of us has to help our sisters to fulfill that great goal: caring for the work of the Catering, taking care of the dining room, taking care with things of laundry, order, looking after the <em>regulae internae,</em> the criteria of separation that our Father has given us, learning how to serve in a better way so that the work of our sisters reaches further, and so that from each one of our homes and our centers, there radiates that spirit of Christian fraternity that hopefully will help to spread the seeds of many vocations in many families.</p>

<p>Don Álvaro continues, “Without wanting to be exhaustive, I want to remind you of certain concrete points that we have to keep very much in mind as we try to faithfully fulfill the Work of God on this earth.”</p>

<p>Like our Father Abraham, you could say of our Founder that he believed “against all hope” (Rom. 4:18), confiding in the Word of God. That supernatural sureness that the Work would be carried out was confirmed to him by Our Lord on many different occasions. It presupposed the exercise of a heroic faith on the part of our Founder.</p>

<p>As we look to the future, we’re also called to have heroic faith in our vocation, in the Church, in the Holy Father, in Our Father God who is beside us all the time—in this particular apostolic task that God has placed in front of me, this Circle, that class, this recollection, this retreat, this town or village that I have to try and bring the Work to, with a number of journeys.</p>

<p>Lord, help me to have the same hope, confidence, fortitude, perseverance as our Father had in fulfilling these things.</p>

<p>Don Álvaro continues, “Without failing before any of the difficulties that humanly speaking were enormous, difficulties that presented themselves to him along his pathway, he didn’t vacillate in any way. He thought of that aspiration: ‘The waters will pass through the mountains’ (Ps. 104:10). Our Lord comforted him with that aspiration on the 12th of December 1931 when the obstacles to the development of the Work were truly immense.</p>

<p>“None of us in our efforts to spend ourselves to bring forth Opus Dei will ever encounter the same sort of obstacles that our Father encountered. God placed these aspirations in his soul, in his heart, so that he would transmit them to us, so that we would always walk with faith and optimism along the pathways of the earth, very confident that God is acting in us and through us.</p>

<p>“With the fortitude of God and the faith of our Founder,” said Don Álvaro, “we have to personify until the end of time ‘waters will pass through the mountains,’ overcoming all sorts of difficulties that will never be lacking.”</p>

<p>We can’t be surprised that there are difficulties or crosses or problems. That’s par for the course. It’s a given. It’s a good sign. God blesses us with the cross.</p>

<p>The Father has said that the expansion of Opus Dei goes forward in and from the cross. We’re not surprised by the cross in our life. We can thank God for those crosses. They help us to be more supernatural, to turn to our prayer a little more.</p>

<p>One time, many years ago, Don Álvaro went to visit England. He was told that they were redoing a number of the centers, doing a lot of rebuilding and extending and all sorts of developments, and that they had huge financial problems.</p>

<p>Don Álvaro said, “Wonderful. I wish you many financial problems, because then you will pray more.”</p>

<p>The problems lead us to pray, lead us to be supernatural. These were great lessons that our Father and Don Álvaro learned in the course of time that they wanted to transmit to us.</p>

<p>He continues, “This must be our attitude in our personal apostolate, and in the tasks that the Work confides to us. Sure of the power of God, with the spirit of initiative and the mentality of pioneers, we have to launch ourselves to open up new channels through which the spirit of Opus Dei can circulate, carrying to the most diverse environments that supernatural savor capable of vivifying all honorable human occupations.”</p>

<p>What an enormous horizon! Through our friends and contacts, we come to know of new environments, professions, areas where perhaps the spirit of God and the doctrine of God needs to circulate.</p>

<p>So many people who are in need of new ideas or of doctrine are in formerly Christian countries that have forgotten all their Christian formation and need to be born again.</p>

<p>We are here to carry out this great work of evangelization. God wants to use inadequate instruments with all of their miseries—that is, each one of us.</p>

<p>“We can’t dilute,” he says, “our personal responsibility, that of each one of us, into that of the directors or a supposed structure. Our Father affirmed that the Work is ‘a disorganized organization.’ That means that as a consequence, there could never be lacking our personal spontaneity, and that of all the members of the Prelature, at the time of proposing and bringing forward apostolic activities.”</p>

<p>Each one of us is to think: What can I do? What does God want me to do? Where can I have initiative and responsibility in bringing things forward?</p>

<p>“The organization of the Work,” he says, “does not hem us in in any way. Rather, through its very nature, it stimulates us. It fosters a great liberty of movement not only in professional and political areas, but that of each one of us, in the enormously wide fields of personal apostolic initiative.”</p>

<p>That word initiative is a very attractive word on the lips of a member of Opus Dei. He says, “We cannot forget that a woman of Opus Dei, a man of Opus Dei, must in all moments be a person who is an apostle.”</p>

<p>We can ask Our Lady, Mother of Fair Love, that she might help us to go very deep on this special day, and ask Our Lord to help us to have a greater spirit of wonder and gratitude for our vocation, as we look to the future and all the great horizons that the Father is placing before us.</p>

<p><em>Mater Pulchrae Dilectiones, filios tuos adiuva!</em></p>

Conor Donnelly</p>

<p><em>(Proofread)</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that You are here, that you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins, and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My Immaculate Mother, St. Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>We're told in the story of Cana of Galilee that “the Mother of Jesus was there” (John 2:1).</p>

<p>Today is the feast of Our Lady of Lourdes.</p>

<p>John Paul II, talking about the popularity of Lourdes in the last century, would like to say that possibly it’s because also “the Mother of Jesus is there” (John Paul II, <em>Introduction to the Recitation of the Rosary</em>, August 14, 2004). Today, the World Day of the Sick, is a day to ask Our Lady of Lourdes for special things.</p>

<p>It's a day that marks the first apparition of Our Lady there in 1858 to a young girl, 14-year-old Bernadette Soubirous.</p>

<p>There were a total of eighteen apparitions in all, quite a large number. The message of Lourdes was, as always, a message of personal conversion, of prayer, of charity.</p>

<p>It was approved as a feast day by Pope Leo XIII, and Pope Pius X extended this feast day to the Universal Church. Bernadette herself was beatified and canonized by Pope Pius XI in 1925.</p>

<p>A couple of years previously, in 1854, the Church had defined as infallible the dogma of the Immaculate Conception. Then just four years later, in this very obscure little village which Lourdes is, hidden there in the Pyrenees, a place you'd pass by at the moment, you'd blink, you'd miss it, Our Lady chose to appear to this shepherd girl.</p>

<p>She appeared a number oftimes. Bernadette was eventually encouraged to ask the Lady who she was.</p>

<p>The whole phenomenon caused a lot of consternation of the local people, all sorts of interest and curiosity. And when she asked her, Bernadette said later, “She said, ‘I am the Immaculate Conception.’”</p>

<p>When she told this to the local priest and bishop, they realized there was no way that this little farming rural girl could possibly know what those words meant. But of course, they knew about the dogma that had been proclaimed four years earlier.</p>

<p>Little by little, in spite of many contradictions, and a lot of misunderstanding, which always accompanies the supernatural—Bernadette had to suffer a lot in her family: misunderstandings, accusations of fraud, all sorts of things, punishments—eventually, she was believed, and a sculptor tried to make an image of the Lady that had appeared.</p>

<p>It was a very beautiful statue. When it was finished, Bernadette was asked what she thought of the statue: “Did the Lady look anything like this?” Despite the statue being a very beautiful statue, Bernadette said, “Oh, no, no, the Lady was much more beautiful” (Bernadette Soubirous, <em>A Short Life of Bernadette of Lourdes</em>). The sculptor had done his best, but he didn't quite make it.</p>

<p>There was a curious statistic that I heard a number of years ago. Somebody was talking about the main tourist destinations in France. Of course, when you think about the main tourist destinations, I think most people in Europe certainly would think about the popular places that you hear about on the French Riviera, very stylish supper places.</p>

<p>But curiously, at the very top of the list of tourist destinations in France is Lourdes. None of these other very chic places attract anything like the numbers that Lourdes has attracted over the years. There's something special there. The Mother of Jesus was there.</p>

<p>She appeared with her message of charity, of looking out for the sick. Today is the World Day of the Sick.</p>

<p>She was there to encourage the sick, to help them. And over time, she has performed many miracles; some of them spiritual, many physical. The cures and the miracles are almost numberless.</p>

<p>I met an Australian missionary [Paul Glynn] in Japan. (I was in Japan, I met him in Singapore many years ago.) He wrote a book about Lourdes. It's a rather interesting book. It was called <em>Healing Fire from Frozen Earth.</em></p>

<p>It was like a modern history of Lourdes, written in a very secular way, for a very secular readership of the 21st century, but with very cogent descriptions. You have to admit there's something very supernatural that was taking place there.</p>

<p>Our Lord wanted to entrust Our Lady with very special riches that she would transmit to humanity, a reminder of the infinite mercy of God. Our Lady reaches out to every single person.</p>

<p>In the Litany, we refer to her as Health of the Sick, Comfort of the Afflicted. At some stage in our life, we've all been more or less sick, or we know people that have been.</p>

<p>It's wonderful to know that we have a Mother to turn to, somebody who always understands us, somebody also who can bring good out of every suffering, so that in every little bit of suffering that we might endure and that Our Lady might permit in our life, we know that she's going to take this thing and convert it into something of great value.</p>

<p>Fulton Sheen tells a story of how there was a lady in the late 19th century, late 1800s, in Paris, a French lady, Catholic lady, who married a man who was the chairman of the Communist Party. He was also the editor of the Communist newspaper, a very prominent Communist.</p>

<p>She felt that God had given her this husband to convert him. He was a very intelligent man; she was just a very normal lady. She tried to brush up on her theology as best she could, or her doctrine, to engage him intellectually. But she more or less got nowhere; she didn't achieve anything. But after several years of marriage, she got very sick.</p>

<p>I think it was TB of the spine or something, and she had to be in an iron lung for a number of years. She suffered an awful lot, but she and her husband were very much in love.</p>

<p>One day, after many years, she said to him, “After I die, you will convert and become a Catholic.” He was thinking, “I think my wife is nearing her end.” Because there was nothing further from his mind.</p>

<p>Then she said, “After that, you will enter a seminary and you will be ordained a Catholic priest.”</p>

<p>He said, “Definitely my wife is losing her mind.” There was nothing further from his thoughts; it was outside the bounds of possibility.</p>

<p>Then she said, “Because I have asked God to send me enough suffering in my life, to save your soul.” He dismissed these thoughts as the thoughts of a dying woman.</p>

<p>Then she passed away, and he had an awful lot of grief because he had loved her very much. He wanted somehow to reconnect with her spirit or to relive the moments they had spent together. He took time off, and he decided to go and visit all the places that they had been to in France on their honeymoon.</p>

<p>He began to travel all over France, as they did on their honeymoon. At one stage, he found himself in a small village outside the local church, and he remembered that on their honeymoon, they had gone into the church.</p>

<p>It wasn't politically correct for him to be seen going to churches. He also hated going to churches; he had no time for that sort of thing. But he had made a promise to himself to go everywhere they had been on their honeymoon, so he went into the church.</p>

<p>Inside the church, he got this tremendous desire to go to Lourdes. Well, he had hated Lourdes. He had dismissed Lourdes as one of those Catholic superstitions and frauds in his communist newspaper. He condemned it from a height as silly superstitious stuff.</p>

<p>But here he had this great desire to go to Lourdes, so he went to Lourdes.</p>

<p>Standing in front of the grotto of Lourdes, he underwent a monumental conversion. So great were the graces of his conversion that the thought of going back to Paris and resigning from the chairmanship of the Communist Party and the editorship of the communist newspaper. It didn't cost him a thought.</p>

<p>A couple of months later, he entered a Dominican seminary, and eventually, he was ordained a priest.</p>

<p>Fulton Sheen says, “I did my retreat given by that Dominican priest in 1925. It's not often in the course of your life where you attend a retreat where the preacher frequently says, ‘as my wife Elizabeth used to say.’”</p>

<p>Our Lady is capable of the most monumental conversions. On feast days like today, we join the whole Church and the whole world in bringing to Our Lady our every need.</p>

<p>We know that she knows us very well. She hears our petitions, no matter what they may be.</p>

<p>That motherly assistance will fill us with peace and joy. In the last 150 years or more, she has heard the voices of so many children who pray to her.</p>

<p>Today, somebody sent me a little video clip of a Mass in Lourdes this morning, packed with thousands of people. So, the devotion to Our Lady of Lourdes is still very much alive and well.</p>

<p>Small children, when they stray from their mother, get uneasy. They can feel a bit lost, and more than a bit lost. Likewise, we have to try and make sure that we don't stray too much from Our Lady. We stay close to her.</p>

<p>In the intimacy of our personal prayer, we can ask her for things. Or see how we turn to Our Mother frequently during the day with our <em>Angelus</em>, with our Rosary, maybe in our <em>Morning Offering</em>, with our <em>Memorares</em>, or other little aspirations that we may say, asking for help in this thing or that thing, or lights to understand things a little better, or the fortitude we need to get this thing done, or that problem solved, or placing before her all of our children and grandchildren, so that we are truly a powerful force in their lives, a force of prayer.</p>

<p>I remember I had a relation whose parents were not—well, one was Catholic, one wasn't—they weren't practicing. This little girl managed to make her First Holy Communion. I remember my mother commenting, “It's the prayers of your grandmother.”</p>

<p>I always remember those words, trying to figure out, How do the prayers of my grandmother have anything to do with this little seven-year-old making her First Holy Communion?—as though saying it was a major miracle.</p>

<p>There are many things, perhaps as parents and grandparents, that we bring about through our prayer, and that God has been planning from all eternity, and our fidelity in prayer, our turning to Our Lady:</p>

<p>“Remember, O most Gracious Virgin Mary, that never was it known, that anyone who fled to your protection, implored your help, or sought your intercession was left unaided” (Prayer, <em>The Memorare</em>).</p>

<p>We know she's looking out for us all the time. She had a very clear message when she appeared in the grotto. She wanted to remind humanity of the need for conversion and penance. In nearly all of her apparitions, she said the same thing.</p>

<p>As in nearly all of her other apparitions, she's also prayed the Rosary with Bernadette, as though emphasizing the power of the Rosary.</p>

<p>She also spoke of how we can be co-redeemers with Christ, redeeming with Him, uniting our sufferings with Him on the Cross—any pain, physical or moral, difficulties in our life, challenges, contradictions, mysteries—and also voluntary mortifications that we might do some day out of generosity, offering those things to Our Lady in atonement for all the sins of men.</p>

<p>With Our Lady beside us, we can come to see how things that might appear to be a great tragedy can in fact bring about great good, and consider it through the eyes of faith.</p>

<p>I was at a special Mass about a week or so ago in Msongari in Loreto in Nairobi. It was the 100th anniversary of the Loreto Sisters in Kenya, and of course it was a very special moment. It’s possibly one of the longest-serving religious orders in Kenya.</p>

<p>Archbishop Kivuva [Martin Kuviva Musonde] said the Mass and he was saying many beautiful things about the contribution the Sisters had made to the Church in Kenya; what the Church in Kenya would not have been if it hadn't been for Loreto Sisters, and how he'd asked a number of kids, “Do you go to Loreto School?” They'd say, “No, but my mother did.”</p>

<p>He said, half the country said the same thing, in a couple of little clips that are very apt.</p>

<p>But being at this Mass and thinking about the six Sisters that arrived here in 1921, and a hundred years later, I reckon about a million girls have been educated. You can trust that beginning with the arrival point that we've reached 100 years later, it’s just unimaginable.</p>

<p>We couldn't even dream about it or think about it. Just incredible. You can't explain it in human terms. But of course, the story is one of faith and also one of heroism.</p>

<p>Along the way, there have been a lot of tragedies. There was a bus that went off the road in Meru a couple of years ago. Some students lost their lives, some lost limbs.</p>

<p>There was a train in the late 1990s that was coming from Mombasa with two Kenyan Loreto Sisters who were destined for important administrative positions, perhaps in the development of their order. There was a flood, the bridge was washed away, and when the train came there, it went into the river and that was the end of those nuns.</p>

<p>All sorts of heartbreaking tragedies have been part of the story. But when 100 years have passed and you look back, it's just amazing what has been achieved.</p>

<p>You see what God wants to do with our correspondence to grace. In our marriage, in our family, despite the contradictions or the difficulties or the things that haven't worked out, it's all a story of faith, of heroism, and of grace.</p>

<p>We can have great faith and trust in all the miracles that Our Lady wants to work in us and through us, through our fidelity, and places these examples before us.</p>

<p>This is a great message that we can transmit to people who may have illnesses, serious illnesses, maybe chronic things, or people who are born disabled, or who don't have the physical or mental talents that we might have. All these things invite us to trust more in God and to put God's power above our meager efforts.</p>

<p>He can do much greater things in a much greater way, but He just wants to use us as His humble instruments.</p>

<p>Maybe we make mistakes, and maybe things go wrong, but we just put one foot in front of the other. St. Paul tells us that we will not be tested beyond our strength (<em>cf</em>. 1 Cor. 10:13).</p>

<p>Even though there might be contradictions, or difficulties, or heartbreaks, we see these things through the eyes of faith, and we know that God has permitted this thing.</p>

<p>If He gives me this cross, He’ll give me the grace to be able to carry it. There will be no trial that will be too much.</p>

<p>If we remember that we are just children of God, children of Mary, we know that He will never let us down. The millions and millions of people that go to Lourdes every year, in many ways that's what they're stating with their feet. They go there to entrust themselves once again to Our Lady, telling her that we know that she will never give us more than we can handle.</p>

<p>St. Augustine says, “Do everything possible and ask for what is impossible” (<em>cf</em>. St. Augustine, <em>Treatise on Nature and Grace</em>).</p>

<p>St. Josemaría used to say, “We're not just here to do the possible, anybody can do the possible; we're here to do the impossible” (<em>cf</em>. Josemaría Escrivá, <em>The Forge</em>, Point 216).</p>

<p>When you look at the history of that particular religious order, you see that in many ways they've achieved the impossible.</p>

<p>Some of them were telling me that when they set up Loreto Limuru, the first school for African girls in the whole of East Africa, sometimes they didn't have food to eat. or in the emergency, the bullets were flying with the Mau Mau, all sorts of amazing challenges. But yet they hung in there.</p>

<p>Some of them were saying that when they got the initial girls that came to the first school, they managed to convince some of the chiefs to try and educate their daughters. Education was unheard of. The first group of ten or twelve came to the school, and within twenty-four hours, they all ran away. They had to be coaxed back to the school.</p>

<p>Then it was a boarding school. It was far away from where they lived, so they had to live in conditions, and they had sacks that were filled with grass. That's what the mattresses were. It was all very rudimentary.</p>

<p>But little by little they got these girls to the stage of doing the Cambridge exam. It was a big thing to be able to send the papers of these girls, after decades, to be corrected in England and get that standard.</p>

<p>This nun told me that when they sent the papers of the girls to be corrected in England, the nuns kept a carbon copy of the answers of the girls, in case the ship went down. Wow. Nothing was to stand in the way of the education of these girls.</p>

<p>You hear an anecdote or two like that, and you realize, my goodness, these were some women, with incredible ideas. That's why Archbishop Kivuva was able to say they have changed the face of education in this country. They set the standards, and they did incredible things, in the face of all sorts of difficulties.</p>

<p>Of course, their great boast is Wangari Maathai, a Nobel Prize winner. Not every school can boast of that. But of course, to achieve those sorts of things, there's commitment, there's ideals, there's the whole missionary thrust of the Church, the whole social teaching of the Church.</p>

<p>I wrote a bit of an article about this event, and I was saying: You know, we hear an awful lot about the empowerment of women in the world today in the 21st century, as though this is something enormously new.</p>

<p>But if you look back 100 years ago, these women were full of the ideals of the empowerment of women. It's very deeply there, the social teaching of the Catholic Church.</p>

<p>And they had to overcome all sorts of obstacles to make it happen: colonial governments and powers and all sorts of things. That's why their school was far away from Nairobi, near the railway.</p>

<p>We see a story of people going forward, step by step, doing things with the help of Our Lady, not being held back by anything, by any human force. We learn from this how we have to try and have that same faith.</p>

<p>John Paul II talked about how the vocation, or anybody's vocation, but particularly the vocation of Our Lady, was “a pilgrimage of faith” (John Paul II, <em>General Audience</em>, March 21, 2001; Vatican II, <em>Lumen gentium</em>, Point 58). A pilgrimage is a journeying forward, step by step.</p>

<p>The whole of your marriage vocation is a pilgrimage of faith. The whole of your Christian vocation, your apostolic vocation—there's always something for us to do. God is working there behind the scenes all the time.</p>

<p>We find many people going to shrines of Our Lady. Here in this country we have national shrines in Subukia; there's another one coming up in Kitui. Probably they will mushroom over time.</p>

<p>It’s a pretty good thing to let our children and grandchildren be aware of these places, or to go on pilgrimages there from time to time.</p>

<p>We hope to foster Marian piety, so that people also know the history of these sorts of places—particularly Lourdes, the major Marian shrine in the world—and to see how it's a place for them to go to, or a devotion to Our Lady of Lourdes, in time of difficulty.</p>

<p>John Paul II liked to ask the question, “Why is it precisely the sick who go on pilgrimage to Lourdes?” He says, “...because the Mother of Jesus is there” (John Paul II, <em>Homily</em>, February 11, 1980).</p>

<p>Some powerful, attractive force. She draws them there with great power because they know that she's there somehow.</p>

<p>I heard a story recently about a very good father somewhere in the rural States. On the parish grounds, there was a grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes, as there are all over the world.</p>

<p>He had a young son, and he wanted to have the son to have a lot of Marian piety. The son happened to ask him, “What's this grotto all about?”</p>

<p>He said, “Well, this is a very, very famous grotto. It goes back a long way in history, and there's one just like it in France. This was the major one here in our parish.” Some people get the story a little bit wrong, but at least the intentions are there.</p>

<p>John Paul II says, “The miraculous cure remains, however, in spite of everything, an exceptional event. Christ's salvific power, propitiated by the intercession of His Mother, is revealed at Lourdes, particularly in the spiritual sphere. It is in the hearts of the sick that Mary makes the voice of her Son heard: a voice that dissolves miraculously the stiffening of bitterness and rebellion, and restores eyes to the soul to see in a new light the world, others, and one's destiny” (<em>ibid</em>.).</p>

<p>To people who may be suffering a lot, or long term, or God may have afflicted them with special things, this story that their suffering can be worthwhile, can be reunited to the Cross of Christ, and have enormous meritorious value—this changes everything.</p>

<p>It makes them thank God for the crosses that He sends them. It helps them to see each day in a different way. We see that all the little difficult things that we may do—it's all earning great rewards for us in heaven.</p>

<p>Our Lady leads us to her Son, who has a special love for the sick. Christ went around the place “doing good and healing all…” (Acts 10:38).</p>

<p>He loved to heal people. He didn’t heal the whole world, but He did heal an awful lot of people.</p>

<p>We see how Christ reaches out to them. We can also see in the people we know, elderly or sick, that Christ is there in this person. “Whenever you did it to one of these little ones, you did it to me” (Matt. 25:40).</p>

<p>It can be a very consoling thought when we reach out in some way to people that we needn't reach out to, or we go the extra mile, or we go out of our way in some way, or maybe we don't get any thanks, or we're not appreciated: “Whenever you did it to one of these little ones, you did it to me” (Matt. 25:40).</p>

<p>Tell Our Lord, We're doing it for you. It's not just for human thanks or human glory.</p>

<p>John Paul liked to say, “Christ was sensitive to every human suffering, whether of the body or of the soul” (John Paul II, Apostolic Letter, <em>Salvifici</em> <em>Doloris</em>, Point 16, February 11, 1984). There are many people in the world who are suffering.</p>

<p>We are on the weekend of the hearts, the 14th of February, all around the place, and Valentine's. Everybody's talking about hearts, and we see lovely hearts all drawn beautifully, and they all link up together again.</p>

<p>John Paul II liked to say that our hearts are not like that, because God has taken a piece of our heart, and He's kept it for Himself in heaven. We only get that piece of our heart back when we go to heaven.</p>

<p>When we pray for a while, maybe He gives it back to us for a while as well. But he said we all suffer from a hole in the heart, and that hole can only be filled by God.</p>

<p>Nothing in this world satisfies it. If those Valentine's Day hearts drew the truth, there'd be a big jagged edge missing from all of those hearts.</p>

<p>“Our hearts are restless, Lord, until they rest in you” (St. Augustine, <em>Confessions</em>).</p>

<p>Christ allowed His heart to be fit by a lance on the Cross, allowed His heart to be broken, so that He could be like the patron saint of all broken hearts.</p>

<p>Our Lady allowed her heart to be pierced by a spiritual sword (<em>cf</em>. Luke 2:35), so that she could be there also.</p>

<p>Fulton Sheen says, “Only Christ and Our Lady can mend broken hearts, but you've got to give them all the pieces.”</p>

<p>There was an English Lord who was in Nairobi about ten years ago. He came to give a talk at an Ethics Conference at Strathmore University: Lord Alton. He is the main Catholic peer.</p>

<p>In his discourse, he said one thing that was rather interesting. He said, “Only Christianity can change the hearts of men. Governments can't, NGOs can't. Only Christ can, only Christianity.”</p>

<p>This is one of the great powers of the Church, the power to change the hearts of men. We have an inroad into every human heart.</p>

<p>Our Lady has that inroad, the capacity to change hearts with beauty, with truth, and with love. Our Mother is there guiding us to those hearts, that we can give that witness, in our family, in our neighborhood, in the things we do, in the way that we carry the crosses that He gives us, knowing that there will always be sufficient graces, in difficult circumstances, that we can use to draw our friends closer to Him.</p>

<p>We can certainly ask Our Lord to heal our infirmities and resolve our problems. We can ask Him that we might be more docile to His grace, and increase our faith, our hope, our charity.</p>

<p>There were many things initially that Bernadette did not understand. It took quite a while for her to grasp what was taking place. But then, with her correspondence, as she entered a convent, she underwent a lot of sufferings in her life. And she died young, but always happy.</p>

<p>We can put our pains and our sufferings in the hands of God.</p>

<p>“Therefore,” He says, “do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will have anxieties of its own. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble” (Matt. 6:34).</p>

<p>Everybody has a cross to carry. We solve all our problems by thinking about the others, helping that other person to correspond generously to the will of God for them.</p>

<p>One spiritual writer says, “Suffering, which in the eyes of men is so disagreeable, can be a fountain of sanctification and apostolate when it is united to Christ” (Adolphe Tanquerey, <em>The Divinization of Suffering</em>).</p>

<p>It is the great secret of Christianity that we have to communicate to other people: there is an opportunity to co-redeem with Jesus, to be beside Mary on the Cross, to atone to their hearts for all the ways in which their hearts suffer.</p>

<p>Many times, when Our Lady appeared, she talked about that heart of Christ’s that was suffering: “Behold, this heart that has loved men so much...and all I get in return are insults. And it is those that are most consecrated to me very often that hurt me most.” These were Christ’s words to St. Margaret Mary Alacoque (Émile Bougaud, <em>Life of the Blessed Margaret Mary Alacoque</em>).</p>

<p>We are called to atone to that heart of Mary, that Immaculate Heart, to offer her things that ease the pain, that say that we’re sorry, that we want to improve our life. We know that Our Mother will give us consolation, she’s Consoler of the Afflicted, Help of the Sick, Help of Christians.</p>

<p>She is always there in all those moments for us to go to her. Mary, Our Lady of Lourdes, may we spread your message with our words and with our actions.</p>

<p>May we foster that devotion to you, which we know you want us to spread around the place, and help many people to find consolation in finding joy in your Immaculate Heart.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, St. Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

Conor Donnelly</p>

<p>(<em>Proofread</em>)</p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>“Like living stones, let yourself be built into a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ” (1 Pet. 2:5), we are told in the letter of Saint Peter. Today is the anniversary of the founding of the Priestly Society of the Holy Cross.</p>

<p>St. Josemaría was a diocesan priest. He had great love for all diocesan priests and all priests, but he particularly wanted to do something, and saw that God wanted him to do something, to help diocesan priests, particularly in their spiritual life.</p>

<p>On the one hand, he saw that he was called to found Opus Dei, but he was all the time searching for a way whereby that spirit of Opus Dei and the formation that was there could be extended to diocesan priests. Little by little, God let him see that that was possible.</p>

<p>On the 14th of February 1943, the Priestly Society of the Holy Cross was born. The Priestly Society is an association of priests inseparably united to Opus Dei.</p>

<p>All the formation that lay people receive in Opus Dei—to sanctify their work, to be holy in the middle of the world—priests also can receive. It provides ongoing formation for priests to help them in their spiritual life and professional life through all the various means that Opus Dei uses: regular Confessions, spiritual direction, circles, retreats, seminars.</p>

<p>It tries to foster a great priestly fraternity among the clergy, all the time in very close union with the bishop. There was a juridical problem because diocesan priests could not become members of Opus Dei because their superior is their bishop. The association of priests was formed whereby the Prelate of Opus Dei is concurrently the president of the Priestly Society of the Holy Cross.</p>

<p>That way the juridical bond of the diocesan priest with their bishop to whom they are answerable, and his care for them, is maintained. They benefit from the spirit of Opus Dei while maintaining themselves juridically incardinated in their diocese.</p>

<p>St. Josemaría liked to say that today is a day of prayer for priests. He indicated a number of special days in the year for that.</p>

<p>The anniversary of the first three priests of Opus Dei is on June 25th and the Feast of the Curé of Ars, the patron saint of all parish priests, is on August 4th. It’s a day of prayer for priests, priests of the universal Church, and also very particularly, priests of the Prelature.</p>

<p>St. Josemaría brought something like a thousand priests to the altar. Blessed Álvaro brought about 700. He’s taught us to have a great love for the institution of the priesthood, to have great love and respect for priests.</p>

<p>While priests are ordained to the ministerial priesthood, he liked to remind all lay people that they also have a participation in what is called the common priesthood of the faithful, or the universal priesthood of the faithful, that we receive with our Baptism.</p>

<p>Even though we might not be ordained to the ministerial priesthood, we are all called to live out our priesthood in union with Christ on the Cross. And ultimately that’s what priestly soul means: having the same sentiments as Christ on the Cross.</p>

<p>Lay people are not ordained to administer the sacraments, which is the main function of the ordained ministry, priestly ministry. The lay people are called to order the temporal realities.</p>

<p>While they have a priestly soul, they’re called to have a fully lay mentality. The priestly society gives this ongoing formation to priests to help them to sanctify their priestly work, to be holy in and through their ministry, to be priests 100 percent, good shepherds to the others, and to benefit in this way from all of the things which the spirit of Opus Dei gives us in terms of formation.</p>

<p>The first three priests of Opus Dei—their process of beatification is ongoing. This thing of holiness in and through the ministry is not just a nebulous idea, but something very concrete.</p>

<p>We’re told also in St. Peter, “You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s own people, in order that you may proclaim the mighty acts of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light” (1 Pet. 2:9).</p>

<p>Any way that we can help our parish priests or other diocesan priests to grow in their vocation; it is something we should try and foster.</p>

<p>If you have the means to help your local priest get to an annual retreat or to a seminar or some other means of formation, it’s a very good thing to try and achieve.</p>

<p>St. Josemaría liked to say that every priest can bring a thousand souls to heaven. So, one way of fostering evangelization is that prayer and care for priests, helping them to care for their vocation, being close to them in the parish, helping them to understand also the spirit of Opus Dei through your example, through your words, through your apostolates, in all the things that we do.</p>

<p>What is a priest? A priest is somebody who offers sacrifices. In the priesthood of the Old Testament, the priest offered the sacrifices of animals, the blood of goats and cows and heifers.</p>

<p>In the New Testament, the priest also offers sacrifices. He offers the blood of Christ. The main duty of the priest is to celebrate the Mass. And when we’re called to have the priestly soul, a priestly soul is something we receive at Baptism when that character is imprinted on our soul—the seal of Baptism that gives us a participation in the priesthood of Christ.</p>

<p>Christ was most a priest when He offered Himself in sacrifice to His heavenly Father. He practiced all the priestly virtues of humility, of sacrifice, of service, of obedience, of generosity. In our daily life, we have ample opportunities on a regular basis to practice these virtues.</p>

<p>We’re told in St. John, “In truth, I tell you, unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains only a single grain; but if it dies, it yields a rich harvest” (John 12:24).</p>

<p>St. Paul says, “I urge you then, brethren, remembering the mercies of God, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, dedicated and acceptable to God. That is the kind of worship for you as sensible people” (Rom. 12:1).</p>

<p>We’re invited to make of our lives a holocaust, to live out our priesthood in the ordinary events of every day. It’s not just those who are ordained to the ministerial priesthood that live their priesthood. But the Second Vatican Council talked about the ‘universal priesthood of the faithful” (Vatican II, <em>Lumen gentium</em>, Point 10, November 21, 1964; <em>Presbyterorum ordinis</em>, Point 2, December 7, 1965).</p>

<p>In that sense, we’re all priests. We’re called to live out our common or universal priesthood in our work, in our apostolate, in the fulfillment of our family duties, in our marriage, in saying “no” to ourselves, in uniting ourselves to the Cross of Christ and being there with Jesus.</p>

<p>The exercise of our priesthood means above all to serve. We are all called to serve. That’s the purpose of our formation and of all education.</p>

<p>There was a professor once who asked some students in secondary school, Why were they in this school with the Catholic ethos? They said, ‘We’re here to do well in our final exam so that we can get a good result, so we can get into a good university, so we can get a good degree, so we can get a good job, so we can get a good salary.’ He said that wasn’t a very good answer.</p>

<p>He went to some university students in a university with a Catholic ethos and asked them the same question. They said, ‘We’re here in this university to study and to get a good degree so we can get a good job, so we can get a good salary.’</p>

<p>This professor said, This represents the failure of Catholic education, because the purpose of all Catholic education is to serve, “because Christ came not to be served, but to serve” (<em>cf</em>. Mark 10:45).</p>

<p>We’re called to exercise our priestly soul through service. A priest who is ordained to the ministerial priesthood is ordained to serve. That’s the purpose of his ministry. All priesthood leads to that.</p>

<p>Mother Teresa tells a story of how one time a journalist came to her and asked her, What was her opinion of women priests? She said, “I often think that the person who was most cut out to be a priest was Our Lady, because she was the most dignified person that was ever created. She was conceived without original sin. She was full of grace. She had some very special privileges because of her divine maternity. There was nobody who was created so suitable for the priesthood as Our Lady. But yet her vocation was to be ‘the handmaid of the Lord’” (Luke 1:38).</p>

<p>The following day in the newspaper, Mother Teresa said there was a headline that said, ‘Mother Teresa says that women make better priests than men.’ She had to get someone to call the newspaper and say, “That wasn’t exactly what I said.”</p>

<p>Somebody else said once that a woman who wants to be a priest is as misguided as a man who wants to be pregnant. We need to get very clear ideas. If we hear women talking about the fact of how they would like to be priests, it means they have not understood the concept of the common or universal priesthood of the faithful.</p>

<p>It was very clearly expounded in the Second Vatican Council that we are already priests. We have a priestly soul. We’re called to serve.</p>

<p>We’re told in the Letter to the Hebrews, “Every high priest is taken from among human beings and is appointed to act on their behalf in relationships with God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins” (Heb. 5:1).</p>

<p>One time in Rome in the early 1950s, there was a consistory about to take place where they appointed cardinals. One young fellow said to St. Josemaría in a get-together: ‘Father, maybe you will be made a cardinal.’</p>

<p>St. Josemaría changed the topic very quickly but afterwards called him to his room. This young person was a medical doctor. St. Josemaría pulled up his cassock and pulled up his shirt and pulled up his undershirt and showed him a big red rash that he had across his chest.</p>

<p>The doctor immediately recognized the rash as the rash of shingles, herpes zoster, a very painful infection of the nerve roots, where people usually have a fever. They’re often in the hospital. Yet St. Josemaría was walking around and talking at that get-together and working as if nothing was the matter.</p>

<p>He pointed to the red of the rash and said, “My son, this is the only red that God has in mind for me, not the red of a cardinal’s hat.”</p>

<p>Many decades later, that medical student, Don Julián Herranz, was made a cardinal. I’m sure he remembered those words of St. Josemaría’s.</p>

<p>With our priestly soul, we take the blows, we offer up the sacrifices. We’re willing to be with Christ on the Cross. We find so many solutions to our problems there.</p>

<p>One time there was a get-together on Easter Sunday night. John Paul II invited the UNIV students to an inner patio there in the Vatican called the San Damaso.</p>

<p>At the end of the sort of get-together they had, a musical get-together, he said, “I am very happy to see all of you here from different countries. So youthful, so happy and so united among yourselves from different places, different cultures, and different backgrounds, but yet there’s a great unity among you.”</p>

<p>The master of ceremonies who had the microphone, a young student, was very quick, and added to that: “United to you, Holy Father.”</p>

<p>And as quick as a wink, the Holy Father, without missing a beat, immediately said, <em>uniti in Cristo</em>, united to Christ. It was a beautiful, spontaneous expression of the priestly soul, everything in our life united to Christ.</p>

<p>Fulton Sheen tells a story about how he went to see Pope Paul VI in 1968, just after the issuing of the encyclical of <em>Humanae Vitae</em>, which is all about the regulation of birth and conjugal love. Beautiful document. A major document of the 20th century. It was also known as the document that banned contraception.</p>

<p>The Holy Father was getting an awful lot of flack in the international press. Fulton Sheen said to him, “Holy Father, you’re well named Paul, because Paul they stoned, and now they’re stoning you.”</p>

<p>The Holy Father said, “Yes, it’s 10 in the evening before I get to open my personal mail, and with each letter, there comes a thorn. When I lie down on my bed at night, I lie down on a crown of thorns.”</p>

<p>“But,” he said, “I can’t tell you the joy, the happiness, the peace I get out of knowing that I’m making up in my body of what is lacking in the sufferings of Christ.”</p>

<p>With that, he was quoting St. Paul to the Colossians, who says, “It makes me happy to be suffering for you now. And in my own body, to make up all the hardships that still have to be undergone by Christ for the sake of his body, the Church” (Col. 1:24).</p>

<p>There is nothing lacking in the sufferings of Christ. But what is lacking is our participation in those sufferings.</p>

<p>Really, what the Holy Father was expressing was that sentiment of priestly soul that’s there within him, finding joy and peace and happiness.</p>

<p>There may be some time in our life when we come across somebody with a broken heart. This week, around the 14th of February, the whole world is looking at hearts and selling hearts and buying hearts. They’re all beautiful hearts. The hearts that are drawn on Valentine’s Day cards, one line links up with the other. Very complete hearts.</p>

<p>But Pope St. John Paul said that our hearts are not like that. He said, God has taken a piece of our heart, and He’s kept it for Himself in heaven. We only get it back when we go there.</p>

<p>“Our hearts are restless, Lord, until they rest in you” (St. Augustine, <em>Confessions,</em> Book 1:1-2).</p>

<p>Pope St. John Paul said we all suffer from a hole in the heart, and that hole can only be filled by God.</p>

<p>Even though these days we see so many beautiful, complete hearts, we also know from the human experience that hearts can be broken. Our Lady’s heart was pierced by a sword, a spiritual sword (<em>cf</em>. Luke 2:35).</p>

<p>Christ’s heart was pierced by a lance and there flowed out blood and water (John 19:34), the fountain of the sacramental life of the Church. We know that all these things can happen.</p>

<p>Our hearts may be broken some time, or we might meet people with broken hearts. Fulton Sheen said that if ever God allows hearts to be broken, it’s because He wants to enter into them a little more (<em>cf</em>. Fulton J. Sheen, <em>Through</em> the <em>Year with Fulton J. Sheen</em>).</p>

<p>Our Lady and Our Lord whose hearts are pierced, they’re a bit like the patron saints of broken hearts. They can mend all broken hearts.</p>

<p>If ever you meet someone with a broken heart, lead them to Jesus, to Mary. They find their peace and their serenity there. They learn how to begin again.</p>

<p>The heart is very important in our faith. God reads the heart. “Rend your heart and not your garments. Come back to me with all your heart” (Joel 2:12-13).</p>

<p>Our priestly soul also leads us to have a great desire to spread truth, to give doctrine, to spread doctrine in every way we can, which are good ideas, the ideas of Christ and the ideas with which He wants us to shape the world.</p>

<p>That priestly soul leads us to spend ourselves for souls, to give ourselves to the apostolate with our whole heart and mind, seeing it’s the greatest occupation and ideal we could have that fills our day and every hour with meaning and with purpose.</p>

<p>Christ came to save souls. The Church is all about souls. That apostolic zeal adds a great dynamism to our life.</p>

<p>Therefore, that leads us to never say ‘enough’ or ‘up to here and no further.’ Those words don’t exist.</p>

<p>We’ve come to give ourselves. Christ emptied Himself. He didn’t just shed one drop of His blood, but He let His blood flow copiously on the Cross.</p>

<p>We’re called to offer everything. We hold nothing back.</p>

<p>If we look at Christ on the Cross, we can get a great encouragement, an example there, a beckoning to fall in love with Him, to follow Him, and to never leave Him.</p>

<p>Our priestly soul finds perfect expression in the Mass and in the prayers of the Mass and the liturgy that can be so meaningful. In the <em>Preface</em> of the First Sunday in Ordinary Time, it says:</p>

<p>“Father, all-powerful and every living God. We do well always and everywhere to give you thanks, through Jesus Christ, Our Lord. Through his cross and resurrection, he freed us from sin and death and has called us to the glory that he has made us a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people set apart. Everywhere we proclaim your mighty works, for you have called us out of darkness into your own wonderful light.”</p>

<p>We’re told in the <em>Furrow</em>: “You say that you’re now beginning to understand what a ‘priestly soul’ means. Don’t be annoyed with me if I tell you that the facts show that you only realize it in theory. —Every day the same thing happens to you: at nighttime, during the examination, it’s all desire and resolutions; during the morning and afternoon at work, it’s all objections and excuses. Are you in this way living a ‘holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Jesus Christ’ (1 Pet. 2:5)?” (Josemaría Escrivá, <em>Furrow</em>, Point 499).</p>

<p>We have a priestly soul, but lay people are also called to live out their priestly soul with a very lay mentality. That’s the way that God wants us to live out our priestly soul in all situations.</p>

<p>To be a layperson is a real vocation. It has certain characteristics. Lay people are not called to imitate priests in the way they talk, the way they walk, and what they talk about. Lay people are called to be fully lay people.</p>

<p>If everybody is talking about football, then we talk about football, or whatever is the thing that people in the middle of the world talk about. We’re not meant to be ‘churchy,’ but rather, fully lay and fully up to date with the ordinary things that lay people do.</p>

<p>That priestly soul has a lot of applications. It can mean our total availability for whatever is necessary for the apostolate. It can be very useful in moments when we come to see our miseries, our limitations, and the ups and downs of each day—to carry on there where God has placed us, in this marriage, in this family, in this job—in persevering in spite of my failures, beginning again.</p>

<p>We can thank God for the priestly occasions when we don’t have what we need or what we’d like to have. It’s a moment to offer our minds and heart and soul to God and say, “Here I am because you’ve called me” (1 Sam. 3:5-10).</p>

<p>With our priestly soul, we overcome the obstacles with the spirit of the beginnings, because we know that God is with us and united to our lay mentality. It doesn’t allow us to remain passive in the face of difficulties.</p>

<p>If on some occasion we have a little bit of extra work—in cleaning or in the kitchen or in cooking at Christmas time, or we find everybody wants a barbecue, or somebody is sick in the house—these are opportunities to offer these things to God with our priestly soul.</p>

<p>Or someday we’re not feeling well, or we have to overcome our whims and our caprices, or we feel a bit rebellious—these are times to offer things to God, persevering in the apostolate entrusted to us, and the jobs that are given to us.</p>

<p>The more we think this and live it, the more truly lay mentality we’ll also have. We can ask Our Lord for the grace to live out this priestly soul a little better.</p>

<p>All the time we find Our Lady standing beside the Cross. Mary lived her priestly soul at that moment more than any other.</p>

<p><em>Stabat Mater dolorosa, iuxta Crucem lacrimósa, dum pendébat Fílius</em>. The Stabat Mater that we read on the Feast of Our Lady of Sorrows, the sequence of that Mass, is very eloquent.</p>

<p>Our Lady is the Lady of Fair Weeping. Her tears are beautiful. She has the sorrows of the one who is all beauty, fully free from the deformity of sin.</p>

<p>One writer says the sinless Spirit-filled heart of Mary is beautifully centered on the will of the Father.</p>

<p>Our Lady lived out her priestly soul by fully accepting the will of God in that moment of the Cross. She gives, she offers, she doesn’t merely let go. She doesn’t just tolerate. She doesn’t assist passively or patiently at the sacrifice of her Son. She’s totally involved.</p>

<p>That’s why the Church called her a co-redeemer. [Update: In <em>Mater Populi Fidelis</em>, a Doctrinal Note issued by the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith with Pope Leo XIV’s approval on November 4, 2025, it was clarified in Points 3, 21, 22 that while her unique cooperation is acknowledged, she is not a co-redeemer nor co-redemptrix.]</p>

<p>St. Albert said, “Our Lady joined herself to the Father of Mercies in his greatest work of mercy when she shared in the Passion of her Son and ‘thus became the helper of our redemption and the Mother of our spiritual generation’” (Albertus Magnus, <em>Summa Theologica</em> <em>IV, 15</em>).</p>

<p>With that poem, the Stabat Mater from the sequence of Pentecost Sunday, we could say: <em>Fac, ut árdeat cor meum in amándo Christum Deum</em>. Make my heart to burn in loving Christ Our Lord.</p>

<p>When Cardinal Ratzinger visited Cavabianca in 1987, he said the Prelature of the Holy Cross in Opus Dei invites its members to stand by Mary there, that Our Lord may see us and each of us become a beloved disciple, hearing the words, “Behold your mother” (John 19:27).</p>

<p>Our Lady beside the Cross was silent. We can learn silence from Our Lady. Our silence can be a measure of our holocaust, of our unity to the Cross of Christ.</p>

<p>We can end our prayer by speaking to Our Lady, the Mother of all priests, thanking her for the priesthood of our Father, a priesthood that she helped so much and so continuously all throughout his life.</p>

<p>Help us, Mother, to value the great institution of the priesthood, to love priests like our Father did, to pray for them, to support them, to see what we can do for the diocesan priesthood as God wants us to do, moving heaven and earth to support that priesthood in every way we can, because we know the great evangelizing influence it can have in every country and in the whole world.</p>

<p>Mary, Mother of the Redeemer, Mediatrix of All Graces, Mother of priests, pray for us now and always.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

Conor Donnelly</p>

<p>(<em>Proofread</em>)</p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>A lawyer in Sydney, Australia tells a story of how one day an elderly couple came to see him. He was 86 and she was 83. The lawyer asked them, “What can I do for you?”</p>

<p>And they said, “We want to get a divorce.”</p>

<p>“Why do you want to get a divorce?” “Because we don’t love each other anymore.”</p>

<p>“How long have you been married?” “Forty years.”</p>

<p>The lawyer tried to quickly recall all the points from the meditation he heard about charity and perseverance and fidelity on his last retreat, and he gave them an impromptu talk.</p>

<p>“Charity is patient, charity is kind” (1 Cor. 13:4). It’s beginning again. It’s loving other people with their defects. It’s letting the waters pass under the bridge. It’s not making a mountain out of a molehill, et cetera.</p>

<p>He asked them to go away, think about it for a while, come back some other day, and they would talk a little more. The couple went away, and three years later the wife came back.</p>

<p>She said, “I’ve just come back to tell you that my husband just passed away. But I want to thank you because we’ve just had three of the most wonderful years of our whole life.”</p>

<p>The moral of the story is that we’re always beginning again in love. Love is a mystery. “God is love” (1 John 4:8).</p>

<p>In the course of our life, we try to learn a little more about that mystery of love. Perseverance and fidelity in marriage are very much based on love and keeping that love alive—taking care of that love.</p>

<p>We have the grace from the sacrament to help that to happen. St. Paul says, “My grace is sufficient for you” (2 Cor. 12:9).</p>

<p>He also says; “Let us never slacken in doing good, for if we do not give up, we shall have a harvest in due time” (Gal. 6:9).</p>

<p>We have to keep trying to persevere in doing good, working at our marriage, beginning again; keeping our love young and fresh after many years like it was before we got married.</p>

<p>St. Josemaría liked to give great importance to details (Josemaría Escrivá, <em>Friends of God</em>, Point 122; <em>The Forge</em>, Point 870, etc.). Love is in the details. Perfection is in the details. It’s remembering little things. It’s sweeping the other party off their feet from time to time with little gestures of love and affection.</p>

<p>There is a song by Julio Iglesias in Spain many years ago. It’s the lament of a man whose loved one has left him. The title of the song is <em>Me Olvidé de Vivir los Detalles Pequeños–</em>I Forgot to Take Care of the Small Details. Often those small details can cost us a little bit.</p>

<p>The Lord said, “If anyone wants to be a follower of mine, let him renounce himself and take up his cross every day and follow me” (Matt. 16:24).</p>

<p>That’s quite a program for marriage: to renounce ourselves, forget about ourselves, and take up the cross that God has planned for us. That’s the marriage vocation.</p>

<p>We have a vocation that comes with our Baptism: a vocation to holiness. Then there’s a specification of that vocation over the years and in the course of our life.</p>

<p>One of the specifications of that vocation is our vocation to marriage—to this particular person at this particular time in history; in this particular place; with these particular difficulties of finance, of health, of employment.</p>

<p>St. Paul says, “We’ve been chosen out before the foundation of the world” (<em>cf</em>. Eph. 1:4). Every aspect of our life has been chosen by God. Nothing is an accident.</p>

<p>God wants us to work then at making our marriage a success, and in making our family life a success, so that the domestic Church can really be everything that it’s supposed to be: a pathway to holiness, a seedbed of vocations.</p>

<p>That means each spouse has to try and live like a great human person—a great human person that gives example to children of what being a great human person means—which ultimately means virtue. Living the virtues in a concrete way.</p>

<p>By doing so, we reveal gold—spiritual gold—to the other members of our family, to our spouse, to our neighbors, to our friends.</p>

<p>But gold nuggets don’t sit on top of the soil. One needs to dig. Often, one has to dig with patience, with constancy, with effort. One has to begin and begin again with a new hope, with a new perseverance.</p>

<p>And so, perseverance in marriage is a gift of God. It’s a grace that we have to ask for. Pray for it. Ask for it. It’s the fruit of faith, of hope, of love.</p>

<p>Our perseverance in our marriage vocation makes many things possible. It’s a commitment of love. We’re committed.</p>

<p>It’s not something that’s superficial. We’re not a fly-by-night when it comes to this particular reality. We’ve given our word, and love seeks to be definitive.</p>

<p>God will always give us the power to go on, even if we feel we don’t have any more energy, or willpower, or desire.</p>

<p>To love is to do things God’s way. He said, “I am the way, the truth, and the life” (John 14:6).</p>

<p>In Christ, we find the meaning and the purpose of our life (<em>cf</em>. Pope John Paul II, <em>Homily</em>, August 14, 1993), and very particularly, in Christ on the Cross we find the meaning and the purpose of our life.</p>

<p>We draw close to the Sacred Humanity of Christ and to His wounds: “To draw water, in joy, from the wells of salvation” (Isa. 12:3).</p>

<p>If we trust in Him, we will not be disappointed. We derive our strength from Christ for the battles that we need.</p>

<p>We can “leave the past to God’s mercy, the future to God’s providence” (St. Augustine) and live “the sacrament of this moment” (Jean Pierre de Caussade). It’s a gift.</p>

<p>A sacrament is something that has a visible and an invisible part. We’re living out the sacrament of this moment: what we see, what we feel, what we hear.</p>

<p>But there’s an invisible part. God lives in an eternal now and we know that He has a gold medal prepared for us. It does not corrode. There is merit in struggle, and God wants us to get that merit.</p>

<p>Love is a decision: ‘I will love you into heaven.’</p>

<p>We know that in the battles and the challenges and the journeys of every day, the winds may blow. But if the house is founded on rock—not just the rock of doctrine, but the rock of family life, of apostolate, of Our Lady—the building will not fall.</p>

<p>But for this, we need to struggle. We need to sacrifice ourselves. Sacrifice needs to be always present in our daily life.</p>

<p>Sometimes, perseverance needs sacrifice. If you look at any of the long-distance runners, Kenyan runners that win the marathons all over the world, there’s tremendous sacrifice there. There’s tremendous perseverance.</p>

<p>We’ve got to be careful with that perseverance. To put our perseverance in danger could be a serious sin of infidelity to God in this wonderful commitment of love that God wants us to live out.</p>

<p>At the bottom of all infidelity, there is a pocket of corruption. Something that wasn’t right from the start. Something that needs to be clarified.</p>

<p>That’s one of the reasons why we have to be very careful about our formation: our marriage formation, our spiritual formation, our doctrinal formation.</p>

<p>The Church places an awful lot of importance on formation. Often in parishes, there’s a pre-marriage course or pre-marriage formation. But of course, the whole of our marriage isn’t just prepared for in one short seminar on a quick weekend.</p>

<p>We start preparing for our marriage in primary school, in our own families, in what we see in the lives of our parents, and how we build family life at home.</p>

<p>We work at that marriage preparation through high school, possibly through third-level education. A lot of it involves the formation in virtue.</p>

<p>But humans are fickle-minded. All the apostles said “yes” to Christ, but one changed his mind.</p>

<p>The passing things of this world can never be the source of our happiness. So, we have to be a little bit careful with football, or fashion, or the movies, or professional success.</p>

<p>Our happiness has to come from much deeper things. We find our happiness in the risen Lord.</p>

<p>Just like our marriage, life may not be a romance all the time. There might be periods of dryness, or no ideas, or no affections.</p>

<p>Our spiritual life might be the same. But we’ve got to work at it. Go back and begin again.</p>

<p>The goal of our fidelity is not just for fifty years’ time, but in this moment. It cannot just depend on our mood, on our health, on our hormones, on our family situation.</p>

<p>Fidelity is something dynamic. It’s not static. It finds expression every day.</p>

<p>Mother Teresa was once asked if she really thought that all the things she was doing could make an impact in the poverty of India. Would she be able to solve all the problems of India? The problems of poverty?</p>

<p>Her answer was very quick: “I am not called to be successful. I am [just] called to be faithful” (Art Beals with Larry Libby, <em>Beyond Hunger: Biblical Mandate for Social Responsibility–Foreword</em> by Mark O. Hatfield).</p>

<p>There’s a lot of wisdom for that in every Christian vocation in the world. I may not be very successful in building my family, in building my marriage, in earning money, in my profession, in various areas.</p>

<p>But I am called to be faithful—and to try to do so with a sense of humor and perspective, so that I never give up on the ideal of marriage and married love.</p>

<p>If the solutions to the problems of marriage and family in the world today don’t come from the Catholic Church, they’re not going to come from anywhere, because we have the truth. We have the answers. It’s all there in the documents of the Church. Spiritual treasures.</p>

<p>We have to try and know very well the ideal of marriage and married love to understand what love is. Human love is one of the most beautiful realities on the planet. It’s a reflection of divine love. That’s why the devil has gone to so much trouble to mess it up for young people.</p>

<p>Our marriage vocation is a vocation to witness to the truth of authentic love—the truth, the beauty, and the meaning of conjugal love. That’s why fidelity in marriage is always moving and inspiring.</p>

<p>Fidelity is to fall in love with God—to grow in this day by day, and to foster this around us; to focus on one thing, not many.</p>

<p>Our Lord said to Martha, “Only one thing is necessary” (Luke 10:42). It’s not difficult to persevere in marriage. The vast majority of people persevere.</p>

<p>At the same time, fidelity doesn’t come with age. Often, older people don’t persevere. If ever that’s the case, it’s because there’s been a focal point of corruption earlier. People did not want to keep struggling. They were not in love enough with their marriage vocation.</p>

<p>Virtues are manifestations of love. When love disappears, all the virtues disappear—and a lot of human things: human talents, abilities, intelligence, big degrees, prestige, well-paying jobs, apostolic successes. These don’t necessarily make us faithful and persevering. We’ve got to work at it out of commitment to the ideals at the beginning.</p>

<p>It would be crazy to worry about whether or not I’m going to persevere in my marriage. We just have to try and live today, try and persevere today, to trust, to hope, to identify ourselves with Christ, and to renew our generosity all the time.</p>

<p>Generosity is a very beautiful virtue. Authentic love leads us to be generous.</p>

<p>We could ask Our Lord: Lord, give me the heart with which you want me to love you in and through my marriage and my family, so that I can “sing a new song unto the Lord” (Ps. 98:1).</p>

<p>The sureness of divine love that is with us is shown in cheerfulness. ‘Lord, may others see God in me—sometimes in my defects, but in the defects in which I struggle.’</p>

<p>Our first loyalty is to God through our vocation—to live out today the duties of my state that God has placed in front of me, and to fight to place myself at the service of my spouse, of my family.</p>

<p>Because that’s what it’s all about: all our formation, all our education has the goal of service, because Christ “did not come to be served, but to serve” (Matt. 20:28).</p>

<p>Often, our beginning again in marriage is a question of beginning again in our service. How can I serve better? What is wanted of me? What can I contribute in this particular moment or situation?</p>

<p>Peter Drucker in <em>The Effective Executive</em> asked the question: What makes people effective? He says it’s because they ask themselves the right question. They don’t just do good things or ask themselves good questions. They do the right things because they ask themselves the right question. And the right question is: What can I contribute? What can I give?</p>

<p>If we can contribute something or give something in this situation, in this family gathering, in this family—even though my family members might be on the other side of the world—if I can contribute something that nobody else can contribute, that makes me effective.</p>

<p>If our children are relatively grown up, maybe our greatest effectiveness is through prayer or being faithful to our spiritual life, and giving that example of virtue, of fidelity, of perseverance.</p>

<p>An attitude to foster can be loyalty even on a human level: to be loyal to people, to be true to our word. “Let your ‘Yes’ be ‘Yes’ and your ‘No’ be ‘No’” (Matt. 5:37).</p>

<p>Fidelity is not staying out of other beds; it’s loving the bed that we’re in, with all of its characteristics. For fidelity, we need an inner toughness to dominate the ego, so that we’re not ruled by likes and dislikes.</p>

<p>Sometimes, we need to burn our bridges to give ourselves, to conquer our addictions, because we’re all addicted to something: our laziness, our selfishness, our football, our fashions, our food, our drink.</p>

<p>There was a story of a man in Mexico many years ago who, with his wife, used to go to the bullfights every Saturday afternoon. For twenty-five years without fail, they went to the bullfights every Saturday afternoon, until one day the wife said, “Let’s not go to the bullfights. I’m fed up going to the bullfights.”</p>

<p>The husband said, “Okay, let’s not go to the bullfights. I never really wanted to go to the bullfights anyway.” There was a man who knew how to keep his first love in first place.</p>

<p>With the passage of time, sometimes our other loves can creep into first and second place, and our first love can get relegated to fifth or sixth place.</p>

<p>Often, we need to rectify, go back, and put more order in things, to recognize that we are vessels of clay.</p>

<p>“We carry this treasure,” says St. Paul, “in vessels of clay” (2 Cor. 4:7). Earthenware vessels. We make mistakes. We put our foot in it. We do the wrong thing.</p>

<p>Difficulties to our fidelity can come from our human limitations—our weaknesses, sometimes our tiredness.</p>

<p>There can be a lack of love. There could be important external changes coming at a bad moment.</p>

<p>Never make long-term decisions, or decisions that affect us in the long term, in a low moment, because that low moment can seriously affect the decision we’re going to make.</p>

<p>There can also be difficulties from temporary blindness, a temporary blindness that can pass. It may blow away by next week.</p>

<p>Our Lord says, “The person who puts their hand to the plough and looks backward is not fit for the kingdom of heaven” (Luke 9:62).</p>

<p>Our goal is to keep our hand on the plough and keep looking forward. The devil often wants us to look back and to turn back. If we keep looking back, it won’t be long before we turn back.</p>

<p>We should try and keep our hand on the plough and keep looking to the future, because if we start looking back, we can start to place conditions on our proposed commitment, when we have committed ourselves to give ourselves completely. Unconditional surrender.</p>

<p>‘Dear Lord, help me not to look back.’</p>

<p>That Palestinian plough that Our Lord was talking about was a difficult plough. It wasn’t easy to direct. The soil in the fields beside the Sea of Galilee was hard soil, so it was difficult to direct and keep your hand on it.</p>

<p>The ploughman has to have a fixed point towards which he directs the plough through difficult ground. If not, he may not be able to open up a straight furrow.</p>

<p>At times, the temptation to look back can come from our own limitations, or from an environment that’s hostile to the obligations we’ve taken on.</p>

<p>Temptation may even be provided by the behavior of others who should be an example and are anything but. Because of the way they live, they seem to tell us that being faithful is not one of the basic values.</p>

<p>At other times, temptation could come from a lack of hope, when we see holiness in marriage as just a far-away thing, as remote an objective as ever, in spite of all of our efforts to keep on struggling.</p>

<p>“After the initial enthusiasm,” especially in the early years of marriage, “there could be doubts, hesitations, anxieties that all begin to take effect” (J. Escrivá, <em>Furrow</em>, Point 133). If we’re forewarned against these things, we can be forearmed.</p>

<p>But we’ve given our word. When we give our word, in a certain sense we give ourselves. We put ‘on the line’ what is most intimate to ourselves.</p>

<p>In spite of our personal failings, a true disciple and follower of Christ will be honest and loyal, a man of his word. Whoever keeps His word is faithful.</p>

<p>There may be a lot of people, irrespective of their age, who seem ignorant of the noble obligation of keeping their word, to fulfill the commitments they once assumed with complete freedom, or to behave in accordance with the decisions they made before God or man, in civil or religious life.</p>

<p>Difficulties may arise, but the faith and the teaching of the Church and the example of the saints that have gone before us can show us that it is possible to live these virtues. God does not deny His grace to those who do what they can.</p>

<p>We must be firmly convinced and help others to have the same conviction: that it is possible to live all the virtues with all the demands that they make.</p>

<p>There is a certain idea that may be in vogue around the place: that virtues and commitments are ideals or goals to aim at, but without much hope of attaining them. But we could ask God that we might never fall into that error.</p>

<p>A Christian who is loyal will not cave in when upright moral behavior imposes or seems to impose serious difficulties.</p>

<p>We can ask God for an upright conscience to be ready to face all situations.</p>

<p>There was a planeload of travel agents who were going to an island off Argentina many years ago for a weekend to explore some new resorts so they could write about it and promote it.</p>

<p>Shortly after takeoff, somebody took the microphone and began talking about how “we’re going to have the weekend of our lives; we’re going to have a great time.” The picture he was painting was not particularly savory.</p>

<p>But then there was another man who tried to take care of his family formation and his spiritual life. He went and he took the microphone after this fellow and said, “Fine, let’s have a great time. Let’s have a wonderful weekend. But let’s just remember also that twenty minutes ago at the airport, we left our wife and our children. Let’s not do anything this weekend that might displease them.”</p>

<p>In just a couple of words, he changed the whole tone of the weekend. We have to be that sort of person, creating an atmosphere of fidelity around us; helping people to live in accordance with the commitments that they have made.</p>

<p>A person who may have a desire in theory to practice a particular virtue—they may not wish to sin, but in practice, when the temptation is great or when difficulties arise that are serious difficulties, they may feel justified in more or less giving in.</p>

<p>It can happen in a work situation, or when we’re faced with the obligation to react energetically when sensuality threatens to intervene, or when we need a serious effort to finance our children’s education, or to be faithful to our spouse or our vocation.</p>

<p>We’re told in Scripture, “The rains fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat upon that house; but it did not fall, because it was founded on rock” (Matt. 7:25).</p>

<p>We have to try and make sure that our marriage vocation is founded on rock.</p>

<p>Mary’s vocation was founded on rock. She and St. Joseph faced all sorts of uncertainties, risks, dangers. But yet they listened to what God was saying to them and everything worked out.</p>

<p>We could ask Our Lady with that great title <em>Virgo fidelis</em>, Virgin most faithful, that we might grow our fidelity to this particular marriage vocation that God has given to us.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>“He also said, ‘This is what the kingdom of God is like. A man scatters seed on the land. Night and day, while he sleeps, when he is awake, the seed is sprouting and growing. How, he does not know. Of its own accord the land produces first the shoot, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear. And when the crop is ready, at once he starts to reap, because the harvest has come” (Mark 4:26-29).</p>

<p>St. Mark, writing the Gospel of St. Peter, includes this description of this agricultural process, something which Our Lord liked to return to again and again, possibly something that He learned from St. Joseph.</p>

<p>The main message of the seed growing, night and day, “How, he does not know. Of its own accord the land produces first the shoot, then the ear”—it’s a message for us that God’s grace always bears fruit if we do not place obstacles in the way.</p>

<p>Our Lord tells us how the seed grows when it’s planted in the ground. Once it has been sown, it grows independently of whether the owner of the field is asleep or keeps watch over it, or whether he knows what causes the growth.</p>

<p>These words can be very encouraging, because of all the seeds we sow in the lives of our children, in the home, in the classroom, in the school, on the football field, on the volleyball court, on the hockey pitch. Every little seed of virtue that we sow, every little bit of kindness, every bit of encouragement—and children need a lot of encouragement—none of this goes to waste.</p>

<p>Likewise, every seed that we sow in the spiritual formation of our children, and also in the spiritual lives of those around us—the seeds we sow are growing night and day because God’s grace is there, and we know with faith that all of these seeds will eventually bear fruit.</p>

<p>The seeds of grace sown in our own souls are just like that. There might be something we remember that a parent or a teacher said many years ago in the dim and distant past, or some anecdote will come back to us from some Standard Two class or something some uncle or grandmother said, but eventually, it all bears fruit.</p>

<p>If we don’t place any obstacles in its way, if we allow it to grow, that fruit will come. It doesn’t depend on the person who does the sowing, or the person doing the reaping. St. Paul says to the Corinthians, “God gives the growth” (<em>cf</em>. 1 Cor. 3:6-7).</p>

<p>We sow the seeds, and then we leave everything in God’s hands. We pray for the fruits. T. S. Eliot, the famous writer, says, “Ours is only the trying. The rest is none of our business” (T. S. Eliot, <em>Collected Poems</em>).</p>

<p>God is using us as His instruments in the lives of, sometimes, very few people immediately around us, and sometimes in the lives of millions, and the social influence that we try to have by living our lives as upright Christians. God uses this as a great seed in the sowing in the other souls around us.</p>

<p>It gives us great confidence in carrying out our apostolate to consider frequently that, as St. Josemaría says in <em>Christ Is Passing By</em>, “the teaching, the message which we have to communicate, has in its own right an infinite effectiveness which comes not from us, but from Christ” (Josemaría Escrivá, <em>Christ Is Passing By</em>, Point 159).</p>

<p>There’s an 82-year-old Loreto sister, an Irish Loreto sister here in Nairobi, who tells a story of how when she was in a kindergarten school, a missionary came back from Africa and was going around different kindergarten schools, talking about little children in Africa who didn’t know Jesus, and asking the little children to pray for those little children in Africa who didn’t know Jesus.</p>

<p>This six-year-old little girl was very taken with this. Looking back now, she says, “I think that was the beginning of my vocation. Many years later, I tried looking for that priest or finding out who he might have been, because he sowed the seeds of vocation in my soul. He asked us to go home to our parents and ask them if the last decade of the Rosary each night could be for the little children in Africa who didn’t know Jesus.”</p>

<p>She went home to her mum, and her mother said, “No, the last decade is for the Pope, but it can be the second last.” They began to pray the second last decade of the Rosary each night for the little children in Africa who didn’t know Jesus.</p>

<p>Now she has spent sixty years of her life teaching in a school in Africa and running many other schools. The seeds of that priest talking to those little children are yielding abundant fruit. And here we are talking about it almost 100 years later—well, not quite—seventy years later.</p>

<p>We don’t know how God is going to use us, or how He’s going to use the seeds that we sow or the seeds that other people have sown in the lives of people around us, which over time can bear fruit in our own lives.</p>

<p>This can fill us with an awful lot of hope. It can bring about a deep transformation in our souls, because that grace is always at work, whether we are aware or whether we’re not aware.</p>

<p>That can cause us to constantly make resolutions to be faithful, to begin and to begin again, in spite of our miseries or our failures.</p>

<p>St. Josemaría placed great emphasis on that process of beginning and beginning again. He said the whole of our interior life is a process of “beginning and beginning again” (J. Escrivá, <em>The Forge</em>, Point 384).</p>

<p>We fail here, we fail there, we fall down, but we get up again, like Our Lord on the way to Calvary. That doesn’t matter. Grace is at work all the time.</p>

<p>That can lead us to give ourselves more fully and to try to correspond more fervently with the grace that God gives us; also, in the course of our life, to have a deeper hunger for that grace that comes to us in the sacraments.</p>

<p>His grace is acting in us at this moment while we’re praying, while you’re listening to this meditation.</p>

<p>God constantly offers us His grace to help us to be faithful in fulfilling the little duty of each moment. What is God asking of me in this particular moment as I go through the day? He lets us know His Will so that we can become saints by fulfilling that Will faithfully.</p>

<p>On our part, we have to try and accept this help from God and cooperate with generosity and docility.</p>

<p>Sometimes God may permit great crosses in our lives. I heard a story today of a mother who lost a grown-up daughter in some tragedy in another country. She immediately responded with the words, “I forgive, I forgive.”</p>

<p>God can always give us the graces to react in a supernatural way to the apparent tragedies that may take place in our lives.</p>

<p>In our soul as in our body, something similar happens: our lungs need to take in oxygen constantly so as to renew our blood. Anyone who does not breathe dies of suffocation. One writer says anyone who does not accept with docility the grace that God constantly gives us ends by dying of spiritual suffocation (Réginald Garrigou-Lagrange<em>, The Three Ages of the Interior Life</em>, Vol. 1).</p>

<p>Receiving grace with docility means being determined to fulfill all that the Holy Spirit suggests to us in the depths of our heart. He’s always speaking to us.</p>

<p>It means trying to fulfill our duties as perfectly as possible; first of all, in all those things that relate to our commitment towards God, even if we find it difficult., too much, or we fail again and again. We’re like little children learning to walk. They stand up and then they fall down, they stand up and they fall down.</p>

<p>We have those very encouraging words of Our Lord, who tells us: “Unless you become like little children, you cannot enter the kingdom of heaven” (Matt. 18:3).</p>

<p>No matter how difficult we might find the way that God has placed out for us, there’s grace there to help us carry on in that way.</p>

<p>Sometimes we have to make up our minds to acquire a specific virtue that may be, or may seem, out of reach. We try again and again to bear, with supernatural graciousness and simplicity, some setback or other, without losing our peace, without getting angry, without letting everyone around us know that we’re upset.</p>

<p>We try to live out the peace of Christ in all those moments, no matter how long that setback may last or how difficult we may find it. God moves us interiorly, and often He may remind us of the advice that we have received in spiritual direction, because the Holy Spirit is there.</p>

<p>The more faithful that we are to such grace, the better disposed we will be to receive further grace, the easier we will find it to do good deeds, and the happier we will be, because happiness is always related to the way we correspond with grace.</p>

<p>We have to be docile to the inspirations of the Holy Spirit if we are to preserve our life of grace and be supernaturally effective.</p>

<p>As Our Lord tells us in the parable, the seed sown in our hearts has sufficient strength to germinate, to grow, and to bear fruit. Our Lord’s examples can be very powerful.</p>

<p>“The seed is sprouting and growing,” He says. “Of its own accord the land produces first the shoot, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear. And when the crop is ready, at once he starts to reap, because the harvest has come” (<em>cf</em>. Mark 4:27-29).</p>

<p>First of all, we have to enable the seed to reach our heart. We have to make room for it within us, to accept it, not put it to one side, because the opportunities that God gives us don’t wait.</p>

<p>If on some occasion in our prayer or during our spiritual reading, we get an idea, or walking along the street, some idea hits us that’s related to our spiritual life, it’s a very good idea to write those ideas down. Bring them further to your prayer.</p>

<p>Or some advice that you’re given in spiritual direction, write it down. It might not seem particularly relevant at this particular moment. But with the passage of time, the graces of the Holy Spirit and the lights of the Holy Spirit become ever more and more relevant and fruitful.</p>

<p>St. John Henry Newman says, “The opportunities that God gives us…they come and they go. The word of life does not tarry.” We’ve got to catch the wind while it’s blowing. “If we don’t catch hold of it, the devil can bear it away” (John Henry Newman, <em>Sermon for Sexagesima Sunday: Calls of Grace</em>).</p>

<p>Maybe that seed is going to be a very important seed. “The devil is not lazy; rather does he always have his eyes open, and he’s ever ready to spring, and to snatch away the gift that you do not use” (<em>ibid</em>.).</p>

<p>We need to live a series of little things. The little mortification of tidying up after our work. The little effort to get to Confession on the particular day that we have fixed. Examining our conscience in sufficient depth so that we can be aware of where we’re falling and of what God wants us to fight on the next day.</p>

<p>Living the <em>heroic minute</em> in the morning—getting up on time. Changing the conversation or at least keeping silent when someone is being criticized in their absence.</p>

<p>Resistance to grace, says one writer, produces the same effect in the soul as “hail beating on a tree in blossom which gave hopes of bearing much fruit; but the blossom is spoilt and the fruit does not ripen” (Garrigou-Lagrange<em>, loc. cit.</em>). Our interior life can wane and die.</p>

<p>We cannot keep count of all the times the Holy Spirit grants us the grace to avoid deliberate venial sin, and also all those faults which, without properly being sins, are displeasing to God.</p>

<p>The saints are the people who have responded with the greatest sensitivity to that supernatural help.</p>

<p>Neither can we keep count of all the graces we receive to help us sanctify the actions of our ordinary life, carrying them on with determination, with perfection, and with purity of intention, for supernatural reasons as well as for human ones.</p>

<p>If we are faithful from morning to night to the help that we receive, we will have filled each day with acts of love of God and neighbor, at both the pleasant moments and at those times when perhaps we felt tired and had less strength and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>All these actions help to make us effective. One grace leads to another. We are told in St. Mark, “For to him who has, will more be given” (Mark 4:25). The soul is strengthened in goodness to the extent that it practices goodness; it depends on the distance it tries to cover.</p>

<p>Each day is a great gift that God gives us. He wants us to fill it with love by corresponding cheerfully with His grace and by not being surprised at any difficulties or setbacks. He wants us to count on His help to overcome such obstacles and use them so that they will urge us on to holiness and apostolate. Everything is very different when we do it with love and for love.</p>

<p>We also have to try and avoid any discouragement that might arise when our defects don’t disappear and we come to realize that we have failed to acquire certain virtues. Constantly we have to start again.</p>

<p>“A person scatters the seed on the ground when he forms a good resolution in his heart...and the seed germinates and grows without his realizing it, even though he cannot be expected to be aware of its growth.</p>

<p>“Once virtue is conceived,” says St. Gregory the Great, “it journeys towards perfection, and the ground bears fruit of itself because, with the help of grace, a man’s soul rises up spontaneously to do good. But the earth produces first the blade, then the stalk, and finally the ear of grain” (Gregory the Great, <em>Homilies on Ezekiel</em>).</p>

<p>Interior life needs time. It grows and ripens like wheat in a field.</p>

<p>Faithfulness to the impulses God wants us to have is also shown by our avoiding discouragement at our failures and the impatience that comes when we still find it hard to finish our prayer with depth, or to root out a defect, or to think of God often during our work.</p>

<p>The farmer is patient. He doesn’t dig up the seed or abandon the field because he has not found the fruit he expected within a certain time.</p>

<p>Farmers know well that they must work and wait. They hope to have periods of warmth and sunshine, and maybe they hope for rain also. They know that the seed is coming to maturity, “he knows not how,” and that harvest time will come.</p>

<p>In <em>Furrow,</em> Point 668, St. Josemaría says, “Grace, like nature, normally acts gradually. We cannot, properly speaking, move ahead of grace. [ ]{.underline} But in all that does depend on us we have to prepare the way and cooperate when God grants grace to us.</p>

<p>“Souls have to be encouraged to aim very high; they have to be impelled towards Christ’s ideal. Lead them to the highest goals which should not be scaled down or made less lofty in any way.</p>

<p>“But remember that sanctity is not primarily worked out with one’s own hands. Grace normally takes its time, and is not normally inclined to act with violence or irresistible force. Encourage your holy impatience, but do not lose your patience.”</p>

<p>Just as the farmer, with the wisdom of centuries, does not lose his patience, we must learn to aim very high in sanctity and apostolate, waiting for the right moment, without ever losing heart. We will frequently have to start again with our unmodified ambitious resolution.</p>

<p>We need to be able to wait and to struggle with patient perseverance, with the conviction that overcoming a defect or acquiring a virtue does not normally depend on sporadic and violent effort, but on humble constancy in the struggle, the constancy of trying time and time again, counting on God’s mercy.</p>

<p>We cannot, because of impatience, cease to be faithful to the grace we receive. That impatience, generally, can have its roots in pride. “We have to be patient with everyone,” St. Francis de Sales says, “but first of all with ourselves” (Francis de Sales, <em>Letters</em>).</p>

<p>Nothing is beyond remedy for the person who hopes in the Lord; nothing is totally lost. We always have the possibility of being forgiven, and of beginning again; humility, sincerity, repentance ... Then we begin again.</p>

<p>We have to correspond with God, who is determined that we should overcome all obstacles. We can experience deep joy each time that we begin again, and during our time on earth, we will have to do that many, many times, because we will always have faults, deficiencies, weaknesses, and sins.</p>

<p>We must be humble and patient. God allows for our failures, but He also expects many little victories from us throughout our lives, victories that we carry off each time we are faithful to an inspiration, to a motion of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>St. Augustine says, “They are those who, hearing the word, hold it fast in an honest and good heart, and bring forth fruit with patience” (St. Augustine, <em>Sermon 101</em>).</p>

<p>All are capable of giving abundant fruits to the Lord, regardless of their past history. God is always sowing the seed of His grace.</p>

<p>“The most important thing is not to become like a much-trodden path, like outcrop rock, like thistles. … We have to become good ground. … The heart cannot be fair game for birds and passers-by. It has to provide enough ground for the seed to take root. The sun of human passions and a dissolute life should not scorch the seedlings of divine promise” (<em>ibid</em>.).</p>

<p>The three prerequisites for our becoming good ground: to listen with a contrite and humble heart, to be earnest in prayer and mortification, and, finally, to be ready to begin and begin again in the interior struggle. We can’t let ourselves become discouraged if the fruits of our struggle are not readily apparent, even after many years of effort.</p>

<p>“A new heart I will give you,” we’re told, “and a new spirit I will put within you; and I will take out of your flesh the heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh” (Ezek. 36:26).</p>

<p>If we’re willing to change our ways, Our Lord is more than willing to transform us into ‘good ground.’ He will bring this about in the deepest recesses of our being.</p>

<p>The grace of God is all-powerful. The crucial thing is to return again and again to His side. St. Augustine teaches, “God is a farmer and if he abandons man, man becomes a desert. Man is also a farmer and if he leaves God, he turns himself into a desert as well” (St. Augustine, <em>Commentary on Psalm 145</em>).</p>

<p>We can resolve never to be separated from Our Lord and to have recourse to His merciful heart many times each day.</p>

<p>Our Lady, who is the Mediatrix of all graces, will help all those graces to yield abundant fruit in the good soil that she wants each one of us to be.</p>

<p>(<em>Proofread</em>)</p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>“Salt without savor is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trodden underfoot by men” (Matt. 5:13).</p>

<p>Our Lord has told His disciples that they are “the salt of the earth” (Matt. 5:13). They do to the world exactly what salt does to food, keeping it from going bad and making it agreeable to the palate.</p>

<p>But salt can sometimes lose its savor or in itself deteriorate, and then it becomes useless. This kind of change is, after sin, the saddest thing that can befall a Christian, the point of whose existence has been to give light to many, whereas now, in fact, they have become darkness.</p>

<p>Far from being able to point the people he comes in touch with in the right direction, that person now becomes disoriented and aimless himself. Having been placed on earth to give strength to others, he has nothing left to communicate now but weakness.</p>

<p>Lukewarmness is a disease of the soul that affects both the intellect and the will, and leaves the Christian devoid of the strength to carry out apostolate, at the same time filling him with a deep feeling of sadness and impoverishment.</p>

<p>The sickness starts with a weakening of the will, brought about by means of repeated faults and culpable omissions, of frequently doing wrong, and possibly even worse, failing to do what is right.</p>

<p>The Christian no longer sees Christ clearly on the horizon of his life. Because he’s been consistently careless regarding the little details that are a proof of love, he now discovers that Christ seems far removed from him. His interior life undergoes a profound change; it no longer has Our Lord as its focal point.</p>

<p>The person who is lukewarm finds that their practices of piety have become empty of content; he no longer puts his heart and soul into them. He goes through the motions, performing them out of routine or habit, no longer out of love.</p>

<p>One spiritual writer says: “In this state, a man loses all spontaneity and joy—recognizable characteristics of a soul in love—in responding to anything that has a reference to God.</p>

<p>“A lukewarm Christian is somehow ‘inside out’; his is a soul that has ‘grown weary’ in its endeavor to improve. Christ has faded from the horizon of his life.</p>

<p>“The soul decries God, if he sees him at all, describes him as a remote and distant figure, hazy and indistinct, with ill-defined features, and probably indifferent to him. No longer does he perform positive acts of generosity as he formerly did. He is now prepared to settle for much less” (<em>cf</em>. Francis Fernández, <em>Lukewarmness</em>).</p>

<p>St. Thomas Aquinas cites as a feature of this state “a kind of sadness, whereby a man becomes sluggish in spiritual exercises because they weary the body” (Thomas Aquinas, <em>Summa Theologiae</em>, Part I, Question 63).</p>

<p>All norms of piety and devotion become a burden for us, a burden we find increasingly hard to bear, instead of being a powerful center of energy, driving us forward and helping us to overcome any difficulties we may encounter.</p>

<p>There are many Christians who have sunk into lukewarmness. There is, in our time, a great deal of savorless salt about.</p>

<p>We can consider in our prayer today whether we are going forward with the firmness and confidence that Our Lord asks of us, whether we regard our conversation with Him as the treasure which enables our interior life to intensify and keep growing, and whether we properly nourish our love.</p>

<p>We can consider whether, when we become aware of our weakness and our lack of correspondence with grace, we promptly make acts of contrition to close the breach the enemy has made, and is attempting to widen in our defenses.</p>

<p>We mustn’t confuse the state of the lukewarm soul with the sense of dryness sometimes experienced when we perform our acts of piety, a sensation produced on occasions or for long periods by tiredness, or illness, or by the temporary loss of physiological keenness and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>In such cases, in spite of the feeling of dryness, our will is firmly set on all that is good. Our soul knows that it is traveling directly towards Christ, even though it is at this moment passing over a stony waste where the going is hard and we can’t find a single well or even a spring of cool water.</p>

<p>But our soul knows where its destination lies and goes straight towards it in spite of our weariness and thirst and the unfriendly terrain we have to tread.</p>

<p>In the state of what’s called aridity, even though the soul has no feeling and it seems difficult to pray, to carry on any real conversation with God, true devotion nevertheless remains.</p>

<p>St. Thomas Aquinas has defined this type of devotion as the “will to give oneself readily to things concerning the [service] of God” (Thomas Aquinas, <em>Summa Theologiae</em>, Part II-II, Question 82).</p>

<p>This “readiness” grows weak if the will falls into a state of lukewarmness.</p>

<p>“I have this against you,” says Our Lord in the Book of Revelation, “that you have abandoned the love you had at first” (Rev. 2:4)—that you have weakened, that you no longer love me as you did formerly.</p>

<p>A person who is determined to keep up their prayer, even in times of aridity, when all feeling is absent, is perhaps like the person who draws water from a well, bucket by bucket, one aspiration after another, an act of sorrow. It’s hard work and demands effort, but he does draw out water.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in a state of lukewarmness, our imagination strays and runs wild. We’re no longer firmly determined to dispel voluntary distractions and in practice, abandon prayer with the excuse that we’re getting no results from it.</p>

<p>Genuine conversation with God, on the other hand, even if God allows it to be arid, is always fruitful, whatever the circumstances, as long as we have rectitude of intention and are firmly intent on being close to God.</p>

<p>We can remind ourselves, here and now, in the presence of God, that true piety is not a matter of feelings, although sensitive affections are good and they can be a great help in our prayer and in the whole of our interior life, because they’re an important part of human nature as it was created by God.</p>

<p>But our feelings can be mistaken. You can feel very well, and you could have a big cancer inside you. You might feel very sick, and you might be as healthy as a horse. Feelings can be misleading. Christ’s feelings on the Cross cannot have been wonderful, with three big nails going through Him.</p>

<p>And so, our affections should not occupy a disproportionately important place in our life of piety. They’re not the main part of our relationship with God.</p>

<p>St. Josemaría used to say that the day you’re doing your prayer and you feel awful, you feel you’re getting nothing, you feel it’s a waste of time—he said, “Persevere in that prayer, because that might be the best prayer that you ever did, because that prayer is all done for God; there are no human compensations” (<em>cf</em>. Josemaría Escrivá, <em>The Way</em>, Point 101).</p>

<p>If our prayer and our life of piety are full of compensations, it could be that we’re looking for the compensations, not necessarily seeking Him.</p>

<p>Feelings help, but achieve no more than this assistance, because the essence of piety does not consist in feelings, but in the will’s being determined to serve God, quite independently of any state of mind—which is always so changeable!—or of any other circumstances.</p>

<p>In matters of piety, we need to take care not to let ourselves be guided by feelings, but rather by our intellect, enlightened and helped, as we pray it will be, by faith.</p>

<p>One writer said, “To allow oneself to be guided by feelings would be like handing over the management of one’s house to a servant, while you as its real owner abdicate responsibility for it. It’s not the feelings that are bad, but rather the degree of importance that we attribute to them” (Joseph Tissot, <em>The Interior Life</em>).</p>

<p>Lukewarmness is sterile. Salt without savor “is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trodden underfoot by men” (Matt. 5:13).</p>

<p>On the other hand, aridity can be the positive sign that God wants to purify a particular soul.</p>

<p>In our apostolic life, there might be times when we’re asked to do things that don’t give us pleasant feelings. We might be asked to give a talk. We might be asked to go and find material means to set up some apostolic work. We might be asked to do research on a certain topic for some apostolic purpose. And we might find all of those things particularly distasteful.</p>

<p>Our feelings might not be there, but if we approach those tasks with a supernatural outlook and see that as the will of God for us, then great fruits may result.</p>

<p>We need to have interior life. As human beings, we can be a cause of happiness or sadness, of light or darkness. We can be the source of peace or of anxiety, either the leaven that enhances or a dead weight that hinders the progress of others.</p>

<p>Our passage over this earth can never be a matter of indifference as far as others are concerned. We help others to find Christ or we separate them from Him. We enrich others or we impoverish them.</p>

<p>And we come across so many of these others—friends, workmates, members of our family, neighbors—who seem to go after material goods as though they hungered for them, material goods that only serve to lure them away from the true good who is Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>They can journey through life like people who are lost. If the guide of the blind is not to become blind himself (<em>cf</em>. Matt. 15:14), it’s not enough for him to know the way from hearsay, or from coming across mere references to it.</p>

<p>If we are to help the people around us, it’s not enough for us to have a vague and superficial knowledge of the way. We need to walk along it ourselves and to have first-hand knowledge of the obstacles that lie in our path and which need to be surmounted.</p>

<p>We need to have interior life, to enter daily into personal conversation with Jesus. We need to know His doctrine ever more deeply; to struggle with still more determination to overcome our own defects. The apostolate is the result of a great love for Christ.</p>

<p>The first Christians were the true <em>salt of the earth</em>, and they preserved people and institutions—the whole of society—from corruption.</p>

<p>What can it be that has happened in so many nations? Why is it that Christians should now be giving the sad impression that they’re unable to slow down and halt the wave of corruption that’s bursting in on the family, on schools, and on institutions?</p>

<p>The faith is still the same. And Christ lives among us now just as He did previously. His power is still infinite, divine.</p>

<p>One writer says, “Only the lukewarmness of so many thousands, indeed millions, of Christians, explains how we can offer to the world a spectacle of a Christianity that allows all kinds of heresies and stupidities to be propounded within itself.</p>

<p>“Lukewarmness destroys the strength and endurance of the faith and is the soulmate, in both a personal and a collective way, of compromise and of a spirit of comfort-seeking” (Pedro Rodríguez, <em>Faith and Life of Faith</em>).</p>

<p>It’s difficult to explain many of the things that happen nowadays at a personal and public level, if we don’t bear in mind that so many people who should be awake, watchful, and attentive have allowed their faith to fall asleep.</p>

<p>Love has been snuffed out in so very many hearts. In many spheres, the ‘normal Christian’ now generally appears as someone who is lukewarm and mediocre.</p>

<p>Among the first Christians, the ‘normal Christian’ meant someone who lived the heroism of each day and, when the occasion presented itself, accepted martyrdom itself. It could and did mean very often the surrender of one’s very life in defense of the faith.</p>

<p>When love grows cold and faith falls asleep, the salt loses its savor and is no longer good for anything. It’s just something to throw away. What a pity if a Christian were to become as useless as this.</p>

<p>Lukewarmness is often the cause of apostolic ineffectiveness, because if we are in its grip, the little we do becomes a task devoid of human or supernatural attractiveness, and bereft of a spirit of sacrifice.</p>

<p>Faith that appears moribund and radiates little love and is unable to win anyone over or find the right words with which to attract others to a deep and intimate relationship with Christ.</p>

<p>We can ask Our Lord for the strength to react. We will be the “salt of the earth” if we keep up our daily conversation with God, if we go with ever greater faith and love to receive the Blessed Eucharist.</p>

<p>Love was, and is, the moving force of the life of the saints. It’s the whole reason for being of every life dedicated to God.</p>

<p>Love gives us wings with which to soar over any personal barriers to our advance, or any obstacles presented to us by our surroundings. Love makes us unyielding when confronted by setbacks.</p>

<p>Lukewarmness, on the other hand, gives up at the slightest difficulty—a letter we need to write, a phone call we should make, a visit or a conversation that we need to have, or the lack of some material means. It makes mountains out of molehills.</p>

<p>On the other hand, love for God makes a molehill out of a mountain. It transforms the soul, gives it new lights, and opens up new horizons for it. It makes the soul capable of achieving its highest desires and gives it capacities it had never as much as dreamed of possessing.</p>

<p>Love doesn’t make a fuss about the effort involved and fills the soul with happiness as it surveys the results of its efforts.</p>

<p>In the parable of the prodigal son, we’re also told about the elder son. “He was in the field, and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing. And he called one of the servants and asked what this meant.</p>

<p>“The servant said to him, ‘Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fatted calf, because he has received him safe and sound’” (Luke 15:25-27).</p>

<p>St. Augustine comments: “But he was angry and refused to go in. Are you not moved by the celebration in the father’s house? The banquet with the fatted calf, has this not given you pause? No one will exclude you from the banquet. It all is for nothing, however. The elder son becomes furious and will not go in” (St. Augustine, <em>Sermon 11</em>).</p>

<p>In his fit of pique, he reveals his deepest motivation: “Look, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed your command; yet you never gave me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends. But when this son of yours comes, who has devoured your living with harlots, you killed for him the fatted calf” (Luke 15:28-30).</p>

<p>The father in the parable is God. He always has His arms outstretched, being full of mercy. The younger son is the image of the sinner who converts to God.</p>

<p>And the elder son? He is the worker who has labored in the fields, but without joy. He has served because he had to serve. Over the course of time, his heart has grown cold. His sense of charity has evaporated. His brother has become “this son of yours.”</p>

<p>He is like salt which has lost its savor. There is a striking contrast between the magnanimity of the father and the meanness of the elder son.</p>

<p>Serving God and enjoying His friendship should be a continual feast. The Second Vatican Council in <em>Lumen gentium</em> said, “To serve is to reign” (Vatican II, <em>Lumen gentium</em>, Point 36, November 21, 1964).</p>

<p>The elder son represents those who forget that serving God is a tremendous honor. In the act of service is to be found a good measure of the compensation.</p>

<p>“His father says to him, ‘Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours’ (Luke 15: 31). Therefore, all honor and glory are ours if we are really of God” (St. Augustine, <em>ibid.</em>).</p>

<p>God Himself will give us of His riches. What more can we ask for?</p>

<p>“Each one of us must do as he has made up his mind, not reluctantly or under compulsion,” says St. Paul, “for God loves a cheerful giver” (2 Cor. 9:7).</p>

<p>There are always many reasons for us to celebrate if we truly live in the presence of God. We have a special opportunity to be magnanimous in our dealings with those closest to us.</p>

<p>St. Thérèse of Lisieux said, “How sweet a joy it is to think that God is just. In other words, he makes allowances for our weaknesses and understands perfectly the frailty of our humanity.</p>

<p>“So what have I to be afraid of? If God, who is perfectly just, shows such mercy in forgiving the prodigal son, must he not also be just to me ‘who am always with him’ (Luke 15:31)?” (Thérèse of Lisieux, <em>Autobiography of a Soul</em>).</p>

<p>As we finish our prayer, we can turn with confidence to Our Lady, the perfect model of loving correspondence to the Christian vocation.</p>

<p>The <em>Catechism of the Catholic Church</em> says that in Mary we find the model of all virtues (<em>cf</em>. <em>Catechism</em>, Point 829; Vatican II, <em>Lumen gentium</em>, Point 65, November 21, 1964).</p>

<p>Mary, may you remove effectively from our soul any shadow of lukewarmness. May you guide the angels to make us diligent in God’s service, so that we might always be in our family, in our workplace, in society, the salt that God has planned us to be.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

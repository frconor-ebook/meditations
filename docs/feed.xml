Conor Donnelly</p>

<p>(<em>Proofread</em>)</p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>“He has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich he has sent away empty” (Luke 1:53).</p>

<p>We should pray frequently about our divine filiation.</p>

<p>Our Lord had the habit of praying early in the morning and in out-of-the-way places. We’re told in St. Matthew that after sending the crowds away, “He went up into the hills by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone” (Matt. 14:23).</p>

<p>And in St. Mark, we’re told, “In the morning, long before daybreak, he got up and left the house and went off to a lonely place, and there he prayed” (Mark 1:35).</p>

<p>Likewise in St. Luke: “He would go off to some deserted place and pray” (Luke 5:16).</p>

<p>“Now it happened that he was praying alone and his disciples came to him. And he put the question to them: ‘Who do the crowds say that I am?’” (Luke 9:18).</p>

<p>The disciples often found Our Lord thoroughly absorbed in conversation with His Heavenly Father. We’re told also in St. Luke, “He was praying in a certain place, and when he ceased, one of his disciples said to him, ‘Lord, teach us to pray’” (Luke 11:1).</p>

<p>We are very much in need of making the same request to Our Lord: Jesus, teach me how to deal with you. Tell me what I should ask you for.</p>

<p>We should do this because we can often find ourselves in front of God without knowing what to say to Him or how we should speak to Him.</p>

<p>Our Lord answered His disciple’s request with the perfect prayer, the <em>Our Father</em>. He must have pronounced every word with care. He taught them how to put all their trust in prayer to their Father God.</p>

<p>He said, “Which of you has a friend who will go to him at midnight and say to him, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves, for a friend of mine has arrived on a journey and I have nothing to set before him.’ … I tell you, though he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend, yet because of his insisting, he will rise and give him whatever he needs” (Luke 11:5-6,8).</p>

<p>Whenever we’re talking to God, most probably we’re asking Him for something. That’s because we’re children of God, children in need. For His part, God only wants to spend Himself on us.</p>

<p>When my mother heard us saying, “I want this, I want that,” she had a frequent phrase which she would say: “Well, you never stop wanting.” Children are like that. We never stop wanting. Our Father God knows it.</p>

<p>He says, “What father among you, if his son asks for a fish, would instead of a fish give him a serpent? Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?” (Luke 11:11-12).</p>

<p>We should go to the tabernacle, exactly as the sick and suffering used to go to Jesus.</p>

<p>John Paul, in explaining prayer, said, “Prayer means feeling one’s own insufficiency through the various necessities which man has to face, necessities that are part of his life. Such as, for example, the need for bread to which Christ refers in the example of that man who wakes up his friend at midnight to ask him for bread. Similar necessities are numerous.</p>

<p>“The need for bread is, in a way, a symbol of all the material necessities, the necessities of the human body, the necessities of this existence which springs from the fact that man has a body. But the range of these necessities is wider” (John Paul II, <em>Homily</em>, July 27, 1980).</p>

<p>Humility is a prerequisite [to] confident conversation with God. We need to realize who He is and who we are. We need to realize our limitations before we can appreciate how much we depend on Our Father God.</p>

<p>John Paul says, “To learn to pray means ‘to learn the Father.’ If we learn the ‘Father’ reality in the full sense of the word, in its full dimension, we have learned everything. … To learn who the Father is means learning what absolute trust is. To learn the Father means acquiring the certainty that he absolutely cannot refuse anything.</p>

<p>“This is all said in the Gospel (Luke 11:1-13). He does not refuse you even when everything, materially and psychologically, seems to indicate refusal. He never refuses you” (<em>ibid</em>.).</p>

<p>A little girl once asked Santa Claus, Father Christmas, for a thousand dolls for Christmas. Her father was an atheist. She got one doll.</p>

<p>He said to her, “Well, your God didn’t listen to your prayer, did he?” The little girl said, “Yes, he did. He said ‘No.’”</p>

<p>It was as though she was saying to her father, “God is my Father, you’re also my father. Sometimes you say ‘No.’ You don’t always say ‘Yes.’ But I know that even if He says ‘No,’ He always listens.”</p>

<p>He will never abandon us. In our conversation with God, we have to keep in mind our divine filiation and our human limitations.</p>

<p>We should ask God for spiritual and material goods insofar as they will bring us closer to Him. “For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it shall be opened” (Matt. 7:8).</p>

<p>In our prayer to God, the first things we should seek from Him are spiritual goods—the grace to love Him more each day, the grace to have an authentic desire for sanctity, the goal of our Christian vocation, the grace to do a more fruitful apostolate.</p>

<p>We should also ask God for material goods insofar as they serve to bring us closer to Him. These goods can also include good health, economic well-being, getting a job.</p>

<p>St. Augustine says, “Pray for temporal goods in private, and rest in the knowledge that they come to us from him who knows what is best for us. Did you ask and not get what you wanted? Trust in your Father. If it would have been good for you, you would have received it.</p>

<p>“Before God, you are much as a little child is before you. All day long, the child cries his eyes out so that you will give him a knife to play with. You wisely refuse his plea and pay no attention to his wailing.</p>

<p>“When the child demands to ride your horse, you won’t let him. The child doesn’t know how to ride, and may get injured or even killed as a result.</p>

<p>“You deny him in little things, so as to preserve more important things. You want the child to grow up safely and possess all his own goods without danger” (Augustine, <em>Sermon 80</em>).</p>

<p>And so, that little girl who didn’t get a thousand dolls for Christmas—she knew that her Father God was listening. In only getting one doll, He gave her what she needed or what was important. She can be at peace, trusting her Father God.</p>

<p>And that’s how Our Lord is with us. Many times we’re like the child who doesn’t realize what he’s asking for.</p>

<p>I had a niece many years ago, and a big tree fell down close to their garden. It was all fallen down and the tree had been put in half.</p>

<p>She brought me out to the garden and pointed to the tree and said, “Can you fix that?” Little children don’t know what they’re asking for at times.</p>

<p>Our Father God always wants what’s best for us. Our happiness will always be found in our full identification with the Divine Will. ‘Lord, if you don’t want to give me this thing, then it’s okay. I realize this isn’t the time, it’s not the moment. It’s not the right thing for me.’</p>

<p>Even though what God wills may sometimes not seem so appealing from a human point of view, it necessarily leads to what is in our best interests.</p>

<p>John Paul II once recalled how impressed he was by the cheerfulness of a man he met in a hospital during the Warsaw Uprising in the Second World War.</p>

<p>He said, “This man achieved happiness by some other way because visibly, judging by his physical state from the medical point of view, there was no reason for him to be so happy, to feel so well, and to consider himself heard by God. Yet he was heard in another aspect of his humanity” (John Paul II, <em>Homily</em>, July 27, 1980).</p>

<p>This aspect was the identification of His human will with the Divine Will. We have to want the will of God: “Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven” (Matt. 6:10; the prayer, <em>Our Father</em>). This is the best path to follow. It’s the one prepared for us by Our Lord.</p>

<p>St. Josemaría says, “Tell him: Lord, I want nothing other than what you want. Even those things I am asking you for at present, if they take me an inch away from your Will, don’t give them to me” (Josemaría Escrivá, <em>The Forge</em>, Point 512).</p>

<p>‘If you don’t want these things, why should I? You know best. Your Will be done.’</p>

<p>We’re told in Scripture about the prayer of Abraham, his prayer for those cities who had offended God. He asked, “Will you indeed destroy the righteous with the wicked? Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city, will you then destroy the place and not spare it for the fifty righteous who are in it?” (Gen. 18:23-24).</p>

<p>Abraham tries to save the cities from destruction by giving his beloved God a hard time. He makes his case to God that even a small number of holy people are an immense treasure.</p>

<p>Our Lord takes such great pleasure in those who love Him that He is ready to forgive thousands of sinners for the sake of a handful of just people. God is willing to forget the sins and iniquities of entire cities for the sake of the love and the adoration of ten people (Gen. 18:32).</p>

<p>This is an unmistakable teaching for all of us who seek to follow Our Lord closely. We may at times be tempted to question the merit of our struggle when there are so many people around us who live without a care for God and His rights.</p>

<p>One day, Our Lord will show us the enormous effectiveness of our humble prayers, of the sacrifices made by a mother for her family’s welfare, of the sufferings offered up by a sick person for the Church, of the merit of an hour of study or work converted into prayer.</p>

<p>Yahweh was willing to save Sodom and Gomorrah for the sake of only ten just men. According to divine logic, the good works of a few people can outweigh in value the sins of thousands.</p>

<p>When we struggle to be faithful to Our Lord, we are bound to experience the joy of knowing that we are pleasing Him, for God listens attentively to our prayer.</p>

<p>We ought to pray every day for our society, a society which seems to be moving farther and farther away from its Creator. John Paul II pointed out in this regard, “I think that Abraham’s prayer and its content is very relevant for the times in which we live. Such a prayer is so necessary, to negotiate with God for every just man, to redeem the world from injustice” (John Paul II, <em>Homily</em>, July 27, 1980).</p>

<p>“See what love the Father has given us,” we’re told in St. John, “that we should be called children of God, and such we are” (1 John 3:1).</p>

<p>Awareness of our divine filiation gives meaning to our day. We’re told in the Psalms, “I have been set by him as a king on Zion, his holy mountain, to tell of his decrees. The Lord said to me: ‘You are my son, today I have begotten you’” (Ps. 2:6-7).</p>

<p>In <em>Christ Is Passing By</em>, St. Josemaría says, “The kindness of God Our Father has given us his Son to be our king. ‘You are my son.’ The words are addressed to Christ—and to you and me if we decide to become other Christs” (J. Escrivá, <em>Christ Is Passing By</em>, Point 185).</p>

<p>That’s what our whole Christian life is all about: to imitate Christ, to identify ourselves with Him. We want to be good children of God in the midst of our work and our normal activities, in spite of our weaknesses.</p>

<p>Jesus came to John, just like one more person, to be baptized in the Jordan. The Holy Spirit descended upon Him, and the voice of the Father could be heard saying, “You are my beloved son” (Mark 1:9-11).</p>

<p>From all eternity, Jesus Christ is the only Son of God. “Eternally begotten of the Father…begotten, not made, of one being with the Father. Through him all things were made” (<em>Nicene Creed</em>). We say these words in the <em>Creed</em> during Mass.</p>

<p>In Him and through Him—true God and true Man—we have been made children of God and heirs to heaven.</p>

<p>Throughout the New Testament, divine filiation occupies a central position in the preaching of the Good News of Christianity. It’s presented as a reality that gives expression to God’s love for men.</p>

<p>“See what love the Father has given us,” says St. John, “that we should be called children of God; and so we are” (1 John 3:1).</p>

<p>Jesus Christ constantly revealed this truth to His disciples. He showed it to them in a direct way, by teaching them to talk to God as their Father (<em>cf</em>. Matt. 6:9).</p>

<p>“When you pray, say: ‘Father, hallowed be thy name…’” (Luke 11:2). He explains sanctity to them in terms of a son imitating his father. “Do not even the Gentiles do as much? You must therefore be perfect, just as your heavenly Father is perfect” (Matt. 5:47-48).</p>

<p>He also developed this truth of divine filiation for them through numerous parables in which God is represented as the father. One particularly moving picture is the picture of Our Father God in the parable of the prodigal son (Luke 15:11-32).</p>

<p>The Prelate of Opus Dei says, “In his infinite goodness, God created man and elevated him to the supernatural order. Through the gift of sanctifying grace, we could enter into the intimacy of the Blessed Trinity, without destroying or distorting that nature proper to us as creatures. He did this through the ineffable gift of divine filiation” (<em>cf</em>. Fernando Ocáriz, <em>God as Father</em>).</p>

<p>He makes us His children. Our divine filiation is not merely a title; it is a real elevation, an effective transformation of our inmost being. That is why “God sent his Son, born of woman…so that we might receive adoption as children. And because you are sons, God has sent the spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying ‘Abba! Father!’ So through God you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son, then an heir” (Gal. 4:6-7).</p>

<p>Our Lord gained for us the most precious Gift, the Holy Spirit, who makes us cry out, ‘Abba! Father!’, who identifies us with Christ and makes us children of God.</p>

<p>“‘You are my Son’ (Ps. 2:7). Not a stranger,” says St. Josemaría, “not a well-treated servant, not a friend—that would be a lot already. A son!</p>

<p>“He gives us free access to treat him as sons do, with a son’s piety—and I would even say with the boldness and daring of a son whose Father cannot deny him anything” (J. Escrivá, <em>Christ Is Passing By</em>, Point 185).</p>

<p>“The Lord said to me, ‘You are my son, today I have begotten you’” (Ps. 2:7). These words of the Psalm 2, which refer principally to Christ, are spoken also to each one of us. They can truly make our day and give meaning to our whole life, if we once resolve—in spite of our weakness and frailty—to follow Jesus, to try to imitate Him, to identify ourselves with Him in our own particular circumstances.</p>

<p>In our ascetical struggle we will at times have to consider more deeply the consequences of our divine filiation. At times, this can become the object of our <em>particular struggle</em>.</p>

<p>One writer says, “When we are living as good children of God, we see everything that happens, including the minor occurrences of any ordinary day, in the light of faith, and we become accustomed to thinking and acting constantly in accordance with Christ’s will” (<em>cf .</em> M. Equibar, <em>Why Do the Gentiles Rage</em>?).</p>

<p>In the first place, we try to see ourselves as brothers or sisters of all the people we meet, because we are all children of the same Father. Our appreciation and respect for others will generate within us the same desire that resides in the heart of Christ—the desire for their sanctification.</p>

<p>Another writer says, “Above all, fraternal love will move us to wish that those people should come ever closer to Christ and should be more fully children of Our Father God. We will make our own the concern of Christ for the apostolate, his zeal for the Father’s glory, and the salvation of all mankind” (Bonaventure Perquin, <em>Abba Father</em>).</p>

<p>The manifestations of fraternity, rooted in spiritual childhood, will be countless throughout any one of our days. Prayers for others will remind us. Little opportunities of helping in material things will have their obvious motivation. And understanding for the defects of others will be more readily achieved if we see in them the faults of our brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>Spiritual childhood is just one more aspect of our lives. [Fr. Ocáriz] says it determines our whole supernatural character and shows us how to deal with every situation. “It is not a particular virtue that has its own acts, but the permanent condition of our being, suffusing and permeating all the other virtues” (Fernando Ocáriz, <em>op</em>. <em>cit</em>.).</p>

<p>Whatever the circumstances or the situations that affect us, we are children of God, and this firm conviction fills the whole of our life and our entire way of behaving.</p>

<p>St. Josemaría says, “We are children of God all day long, even though we set aside special moments for considering it, so that we can fill ourselves with awareness of our divine filiation, which is the essence of true piety” (J. Escrivá, <em>Conversations</em>, Point 102).</p>

<p>If we frequently consider this truth—I am a child of God—if we go deeper into its meaning, our day will be filled with peace, serenity, joy.</p>

<p>We will make a resolution to rely on God Our Father, on whom everything depends, especially when difficulties and disappointments arise, when sometimes we seem to be fighting an uphill battle (<em>cf</em>. J. Lucas, <em>We Are Children of God</em>).</p>

<p>It will be easier for us to return to Our Father’s house, like the prodigal son, if we should ever leave it through our faults and sins. We will not lose sight of this truth, that Our Father is waiting to embrace us and to give us back our dignity as His children, if ever we lose it.</p>

<p>He’s waiting to fill us with good things, with a splendid banquet, even though we may have behaved badly a thousand times and more.</p>

<p>Our prayer, just like these moments we are dedicating exclusively to God, will really be the conversation of a child with his father. The son knows that his father understands him, that he listens to him, that he gives him the whole of his attention in a way that nobody else has ever done.</p>

<p>It’s a conversation with God that’s full of trust. It moves us frequently to a prayer of petition because we’re small and needy children. It’s a conversation with God that has our life as its theme.</p>

<p>In <em>Friends of God</em> we’re told, “Everything that is on our mind and in our heart: our joys, sorrows, hopes, disappointments, successes, failures, even the most trivial happenings in our day. We will discover that Our Heavenly Father is interested in everything about us” (J. Escrivá, <em>Friends of God</em>, Point 245).</p>

<p>We can finish our prayer today with that resolution, that we must pray more as children of the Father. With the conviction that we have to turn to Our Lord frequently every day. Like those many sick people in the Gospels, we need to be brought to Jesus to be cured.</p>

<p>Our Lady will teach us how to have the daring of little children in our petitions. We ask her to help us to do an effective apostolate where we live and work.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

Conor Donnelly</p>

<p>(<em>Proofread</em>)</p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>We’re told in the Book of Revelation, “Then he showed me the river of the water of life, bright as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb through the middle of the street of the city; also, on either side of the river, the tree of life with its twelve kinds of fruit. … There shall no more be anything accursed, but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and his servants shall worship him. They shall see his face, and his name shall be on their foreheads” (Rev. 22:1-4).</p>

<p>Scripture draws to a close where it all began: in the Garden of Eden, in Paradise. The Scriptures speak to us about our final destination: the house of the Father, our true homeland.</p>

<p>Through the rich use of symbols, God teaches us in the <em>Book of Revelation</em> about the nature of eternal life. This is the fulfillment of man’s deepest yearnings. We are to see God face to face and glorify Him forever.</p>

<p>John Paul II liked to say that marriage in this world is a preparation for marriage in the next. The real marriage comes later. People who lead celibate lives in this world give witness to the fact that the real marriage comes later.</p>

<p>If we have some cross or some challenge or some difficulty, or our marriage did not work out to be everything that we dreamt of—never mind, that’s part of the preparation. We have great things to look forward to: the “eternal wedding feast” (Pope John Paul II, Apostolic Exhortation, <em>Evangelii gaudium</em>, Point 288, November 24, 2013).</p>

<p>In the Book of Revelation, it says this water is a symbol of the Holy Spirit who proceeds from the Father and the Son. It runs as a river from the throne of God and of the Lamb. The Name of God is to be found on the foreheads of the blessed. They belong to the Lord.</p>

<p>In heaven, “night shall be no more. They shall need no light of lamp or sun, for the Lord God will be their light, and they shall reign forever and ever” (Rev. 22:5).</p>

<p>Death is an indispensable step towards our reunion with God. Children of God should view death as a transition to eternity, a change of home, a change of place. Jumping over the pool that separates us from this and heaven.</p>

<p>Once we’re in God’s company, “night shall be no more.” To the extent that we grow in our sense of divine filiation, we should become more desirous of meeting Our loving Father.</p>

<p>St. Josemaría in <em>The Way</em> used to say, “Foster in your heart the glorious hope of heaven” (Josemaría Escrivá, <em>The Way</em>, Point 668). That means we can look at death without fear, but with holy expectation.</p>

<p>“Life is a journey towards eternity,” Pope John Paul II said. “Every moment becomes precious precisely through this perspective. We live and work in time, beating within us the nostalgia for heaven” (John Paul II, <em>Address</em>, October 22, 1985).</p>

<p>Nevertheless, we’re well aware that many, many people don’t share this “nostalgia for heaven.” They may have grown accustomed to their prosperity and material comfort, as if these things were to last forever. They’ve forgotten that fundamental truth: “Here we have no lasting city, but we seek for the city which is to come” (Heb. 13:14). Our hearts were made to last for all eternity. The things of this world cannot satisfy our nature. They can therefore become an obstacle to our eternal happiness.</p>

<p>We Christians have a great love of life and of all noble earthly realities: friendship, work, joy, human love. As a consequence, we shouldn’t be surprised that the prospect of death frightens us. This is quite natural.</p>

<p>But our body and soul were created by God to be united with Him forever. In the <em>Preface</em> for Masses for the Dead, the Church prays: “Lord, for your faithful people, life is changed, not ended, and when the body of our earthly dwelling lies in death, we gain an everlasting dwelling place in heaven.”</p>

<p>The true child of God “expresses his joy in seeing at last the transcendent perfections of the Father in all his holiness. The child recognizes the condescension of Infinite Majesty in adopting him on earth, in guiding, training, sanctifying, and preparing him for heaven.</p>

<p>“He has invited that child to enter heaven, to be with his Father for all eternity. God [has had] regard for his littleness and gave him the power to glorify the Trinity forever” (Bonaventure Perquin, <em>Abba, Father</em>).</p>

<p>We have good reason to exclaim, as St. Josemaría did: “We shall never die! We will only be changing our lodgings, nothing more. In conjunction with faith and hope, we Christians also need to have this sure hope. At our death, we make only a temporary farewell. We should want to die in the spirit of those words: ‘Until we meet again’” (J. Escrivá, <em>Newsletter No. 1</em>).</p>

<p>In the Book of Daniel it says, “The saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom forever, forever and ever” (Dan. 7:18). We’ll find that everything appears new and young in heaven.</p>

<p>The <em>Book of Revelation</em> says the old universe will seem to have vanished “like a scroll that is rolled up” (Rev. 6:14). And yet heaven will not be a complete surprise for us. It is, after all, the focus of the deepest yearnings of every person, even of the most depraved sinner.</p>

<p>Heaven is the new community of the children of God who have attained to the fullness of their adoption. We will have a new heart and a new will. At the time of Christ’s glory, our bodies will be transfigured.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, this happiness based on the vision of God will not override personal relations. We’re told by one writer, “There in heaven will be found all authentic human love: the love between spouses, the love between a father and his children, friendships, family relations, noble camaraderie…</p>

<p>“We are all traveling in this life. As the years go by, we find that more and more of our loved ones are now on the other side of that barrier.</p>

<p>“This knowledge might be a source of fear, but can also be a cause for joy. This is possible if we believe that death is the door to our true home. It leads to our definitive homeland which is inhabited by ‘all those who have gone before us marked with the sign of faith.’ Our common homeland is not a forbidding tomb, but the bosom of the Lord” (Camilo Lopez-Pardo, <em>On Life and Death</em>).</p>

<p>While here on earth, we find it quite difficult to imagine what heaven will be like. The Old Testament compares our condition in heaven to that of the Promised Land. In the Book of Isaiah it says: “They shall not hunger or thirst, neither scorching wind nor sun shall smite them, for he who has pity on them will lead them, and by springs of water will guide them” (Isa. 49:10). Our Lord frequently spoke of the incredible happiness that lies in store for us if we are faithful.</p>

<p>The soul and all its faculties, along with our glorified bodies, will be divinized, though there will still remain an infinite difference between creature and Creator. We will contemplate God as He truly is.</p>

<p>In addition, the blessed will delight in the knowledge of other people in God—for example, parents, relatives, spouse, children, and friends. St. Thomas teaches that the blessed will know in Christ everything that pertains to the beauty and integrity of the world. Because of our membership in the human community, the blessed will know the objects of Christ’s love on earth.</p>

<p>The blessed, says St. Thomas, will have a clear understanding of the truths of the faith regarding our salvation: the Incarnation, the divine maternity of Mary, the Church, grace, and the sacraments (Thomas Aquinas, <em>Summa Theologiae</em>, Part I, Question 89).</p>

<p>In <em>The Forge</em>, St. Josemaría has written: “Think how pleasing to Our Lord is the incense burnt in his honor. Think also how little the things of the earth are worth; even as they begin, they are already ending.</p>

<p>“In heaven, instead, a great Love awaits you, with no betrayals and no deceptions. The fullness of love, the fullness of beauty and greatness and knowledge. … And it will never cloy: it will satiate, yet still you will want more” (J. Escrivá, <em>The Forge</em>, Point 995).</p>

<p>In heaven, we will see God, and that will fill us with great joy. The extent of this joy will be related to our holiness here on this earth.</p>

<p>Yet the mercy of God is so great that He has prepared additional motives for our joy in heaven. Theologians have termed these goods “accidental glory.” They include being in the company of Jesus Christ glorified, Mary Our Mother, St. Joseph, the angels—particularly our guardian angel—and all the saints.</p>

<p>We will have the joy of being with our loved ones: parents, brothers and sisters, friends, those people who showed us our vocation.</p>

<p>In heaven we will also be capable of acquiring new knowledge using our faculties (<em>cf</em>. Thomas Aquinas, <em>Summa Theologiae</em>, <em>op. cit</em>.).</p>

<p>The <em>Catechism of the Council of Trent</em> says we shall have the joy of seeing new souls enter heaven. We shall be able to see the progress of our friends on earth. We shall see the fruits of our apostolic efforts and sacrifices. At the time of the Last Judgment, we shall possess our resurrected and glorified body. Accidental glory can increase up to the time of the Last Judgment.</p>

<p>We have to foster the virtue of hope so that it will strengthen us in moments of difficulty. So much is at stake. We have to be vigilant in our struggle to be detached from the things of earth.</p>

<p>Our Lord has given us ample warning. In St. Luke, He says, “But take heed to yourselves lest your hearts be weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and the cares of this life… But watch at all times, praying that you may have strength to escape all these things that will take place, and to stand before the Son of Man” (Luke 21:34,36).</p>

<p>We can also be consoled by the words of Our Lord when He says, “I go to prepare a place for you” (John 14:2). Heaven is our definitive homeland. There we will enjoy the company of Jesus and Mary. Here we are but wayfarers.</p>

<p>Blessed Álvaro said, “And when the moment comes when we are to give an account to God, we will not be afraid. Death will only be a change of lodgings. It will come when God wants, being that liberation, that point of entry into the fullness of life. As the <em>Preface</em> for the Mass of the Dead says, ‘Life is changed, not taken away.’ Life changes; it does not come to an end.</p>

<p>“We have a firm hope that we will live in a new way, very united to the Blessed Virgin, as we adore the Most Holy Trinity. This is the reward that awaits us” (Álvaro del Portillo, <em>Homily</em>, August 15, 1989).</p>

<p>But Our Lord also warned us about the cities that would not be converted. He had spent a great deal of time in the cities along the shores of Lake Gennesaret. He granted countless miracles and favors to these people, and yet they would not be converted.</p>

<p>They did not know how to receive the Messiah, about whom they’d heard so much in their synagogues. This was the reason for Our Lord to complain: “Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. … And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? You shall be brought down to Hades” (Luke 10:13,15).</p>

<p>Jesus had sown abundant seed, and precious little of it had borne fruit in those places. Incredible signs had been multiplied, one on top of the other, but the people were not moved to penance.</p>

<p>Without this conversion and a life of sacrifice, it was unlikely that they would recognize Christ in their midst. Tyre and Sidon were burdened with less responsibility since they had received fewer graces.</p>

<p>“The Holy Spirit says, ‘Today, when you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts…” (Heb. 3:7-8). God speaks to men and women throughout the ages. Christ continues to pass through our cities and towns, showering innumerable blessings upon us.</p>

<p>To know how to listen to His Will and fulfill it right away is of capital importance in our lives. Nothing is more important. We need to listen with great docility to the invitations that Christ gives in the heart of each individual.</p>

<p>We’re told by St. Gregory, “God is not to blame when the faith fails to spring up among men. The reason is to be found in the unreadiness of those who have heard the divine [word]” (Gregory Nazianzen, <em>Oratio catechetica magna</em>).</p>

<p>Holy Scripture calls this resistance to grace “hardness of heart” (<em>cf</em>. Ex. 4:21; Rom. 9:18). Men sometimes pose intellectual difficulties as inhibiting their growth in faith when the real problem lies in their lack of desire. Perhaps they just don’t want to abandon some bad habit. They may not be willing to struggle seriously to overcome some defect that impedes their friendship with the Lord.</p>

<p>Mortification prepares the soul to listen to the Lord and to follow His Will. St. John Mary Vianney says, “If we want to reach God, we will have to mortify the soul and all its powers” (Jean Vianney, <em>Sermon on Ash Wednesday</em>).</p>

<p>Mortification can convert our souls into the good soil that will bring the divine seed to fruition. We have to weed out and burn those thorns that tend to flourish in the soul: laziness, egoism, envy, curiosity.</p>

<p>This is why the Church recommends that we review our spirit of penance and mortification. This spirit will lead us to be more generous in our imitation of Christ on the Cross. Closely related to mortification is that happiness which we all find so necessary.</p>

<p>Anyone who intends to live their Christian faith seriously needs to put off “the old nature with its practices” (Col. 3:9).</p>

<p>One writer says this “old nature” consists in “the variety of bad inclinations we have inherited from Adam. It is the triple concupiscence which we need to control through the exercise of mortification” (Adolphe Tanquerey, <em>The Spiritual Life</em>).</p>

<p>Mortification is not recommended as a negative action. On the contrary, it’s meant to rejuvenate the soul. Mortification makes the soul better disposed to receive supernatural gifts. It also helps us to make reparation for our past sins.</p>

<p>This is why we frequently pray to Our Lord to grant us “a time of true penance, a time of reformation of our life” (<em>cf</em>. Roman Missal, <em>Formula intentionis Misae</em>). By means of the Communion of Saints we give help and strength to other members of the Mystical Body which is the Church.</p>

<p>There are three main areas for daily mortification in our ordinary lives.</p>

<p>Firstly, there’s the heartfelt and serene acceptance of the contradictions that each day brings. In most cases, this refers to the very small things that crop up unexpectedly and that force us to change our plans or adjust our expectations. An example might be a minor illness that interferes with our performance at work or that affects family life.</p>

<p>Other examples could include having to put up with inclement weather, or heavy traffic, or the difficult personality of a colleague at work. These circumstances are beyond our personal control. We have to see them as providing opportunities to love God even more. None of these problems should take away our peace and joy.</p>

<p>One writer says, “If these small contradictions are not accepted for the sake of love, they will only succeed in making people become frustrated and irritable. The great majority of our frustrations come from small contradictions which we have not accepted, rather than from major disasters.</p>

<p>The person who lies awake at night, who is gloomy, who is in a bad humor, has usually not suffered some great blow. They’ve simply been unable to turn small setbacks into encounters with God” (Ángel Garcia Dorronsoro, <em>Time to Believe</em>). Such a one loses many chances to grow in virtue.</p>

<p>In addition, when the soul gets into the habit of accepting small reverses as divine favors, it becomes better prepared to face more serious trials in union with Our Lord.</p>

<p>One writer says God came into the world “to provide a healing remedy for the root of all our rebellion and misery. He destroyed many things as useless obstacles but chose to leave pain intact. He did not take away pain, but he gave it a new meaning.</p>

<p>“He could have chosen a thousand different ways to accomplish the Redemption of the human race, but he chose the Cross. It was by this path that he has led his Mother Mary, Joseph, the apostles, and all the sons of God [closer and closer to him]. Our Lord allows evils to exist and draws good for our souls from them” (Jesús Urteaga, <em>The Defects of the Saints</em>).</p>

<p>We could make a resolution to convert setbacks of whatever type into occasions for our interior growth.</p>

<p>Another area of daily mortification lies in the conscientious carrying out of our duties: the basic material in our struggle for sanctity. It’s there that we find God’s will for us every day. We need to fulfill our duties with hard work, high standards, and much love.</p>

<p>St. Josemaría wrote that the mortification which is most pleasing to God “is to be found in order, in punctuality, in care for the small details in whatever we do. It has to do with the faithful performance of the most insignificant aspects of our vocation, even when it hurts.</p>

<p>“We need to struggle against the temptation to prefer comfort. We persevere in our work not because we feel like it, but because we know it has to be done. When we work in that frame of mind, we will work with enthusiasm and joy” (J. Escrivá, <em>Letter</em>, October 15, 1948).</p>

<p>The mother of a family will find a thousand reasons to give her home a warm and cheerful atmosphere. The student will offer up his efforts to study well. In this way, tiredness will become one more offering to Our Lord. We can examine our conduct to see whether we complain about our work, grumbling perhaps about something that should be leading us to God.</p>

<p>The third area of our mortification consists in the sacrifices that we make voluntarily in order to please Our Lord, to make ourselves better souls of prayer, in order to overcome temptation, in order to help our friends come closer to God, and ultimately to help our friends prepare for heaven. We should be looking for ways to help others seek sanctity.</p>

<p>In <em>The Forge</em>, St. Josemaría says, “Bring out your spirit of mortification in those nice touches of charity, eager to make the way of sanctity in the midst of the world attractive for everyone. Sometimes a smile can be the best proof of a spirit of penance” (J. Escrivá, <em>The Forge</em>, Point 149). We could resolve to overcome our moods and our weariness with the help of our guardian angel.</p>

<p>We’re told in the Psalms: “My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. As a deer longs for flowing streams, so longs my soul for you, O God. When shall I come and behold your face?” (Ps. 42:1–2). These are words that are prayed in the liturgy of the Mass.</p>

<p>The deer attempting to quench his thirst with water is the psalmist’s symbolic way of describing the desire for God resident in the heart of an upright person: a thirst and a vehement desire for God. Such is the aspiration of one who is not content to accept worldly success as the satisfaction for human ambitions.</p>

<p>We’re told in St. Matthew: “For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world but forfeits his soul?” Our Lord’s question forces us to take a radical look at the broad horizon of our life, to which only God gives ultimate meaning.</p>

<p>In <em>Christ Is Passing By</em>, St. Josemaría says the saints were men and women with a great desire to belong to God completely, in spite of their defects. We could each ask ourselves, “Have I a true desire to be a saint?”</p>

<p>The answer would most assuredly be in the affirmative: yes. But our reply should not be as to a theoretical question—because for some, holiness is “unattainable, something to do with ascetical theology, but not a real goal for them, a living reality” (J. Escrivá, <em>Christ Is Passing By</em>, Point 96).</p>

<p>We want to make it happen with the help of God’s grace. “So longs my soul for you, O God.” We must start by making the desire for holiness flourish in our soul, telling Our Lord that we really want to be with Him, that we have that authentic yearning for heaven, that we truly want to be on our way all the time, each day, to the house of the Father. We can ask Our Lady, Queen of Heaven, to guide our steps in a regular way.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

Conor Donnelly</p>

<p>(<em>Proofread</em>)</p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>We’re told in the First Book of Kings, “Now, Yahweh my God, you have made your servant king in succession to David, my father. But I am a very young man, unskilled in leadership. And here is your servant, surrounded with your people whom you have chosen, a people so numerous that its number cannot be counted or reckoned. So give your servant a heart to understand how to govern your people, how to discern between good and evil, for how could one otherwise govern such a great people as yours?” (1 Kings 3:7-9).</p>

<p>The passage continues, “It pleased Yahweh that Solomon should have asked for this. ‘Since you have asked for this,’ God said, ‘and not asked for long life for yourself or riches or the lives of your enemies but have asked for a discerning judgment for yourself, here and now I do what you ask. I give you a heart wise and shrewd as no one has had before and no one will have after you. What you have not asked I shall give you too: such riches and glory as no other king can match. And I shall give you a long life, if you follow my ways, keeping my laws and commandments, as your father David followed them’” (1 Kings 3:10-14).</p>

<p>The most important trait of King Solomon is his wisdom, which Our Lord will later echo in St. Matthew.</p>

<p>“On Judgment Day,” Jesus says in St. Matthew, “the Queen of the South will appear against this generation and be its condemnation, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and look, there is something greater than Solomon here” (Matt. 12:42).</p>

<p>Our Lord highlights the wisdom of Solomon and suggests that only His wisdom, the wisdom of the Son of Man, is greater than that of Solomon.</p>

<p>The sacred author shows the origin and the manifestations of that wisdom. It’s a gift of God at the King’s request.</p>

<p>“God gave Solomon immense wisdom and understanding, and [breadth of mind like] the sand on the seashore.” We’re told that “the wisdom of Solomon surpassed the wisdom of all the sons of the east and all the wisdom of Egypt” (1 Kings 4:29-30).</p>

<p>He was wiser than anyone else, says the Book of Kings. “For he was wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite and the sons of Mahol. and Heman, Calcol, and Darda. His fame spread to all the surrounding nations. He composed 3,000 proverbs. His songs numbered 1,005. He could discourse on plants from the cedar in Lebanon to the hyssop growing on the wall. He could discourse on animals and birds and reptiles and fish. Men from all nations came to hear Solomon’s wisdom, and he received gifts from all the kings of the world who had heard of his wisdom” (1 Kings 4:31-34).</p>

<p>The more one acts with wisdom, we’re told in [Proverbs], the more that gift increases in man (<em>cf</em>. Prov. 1:5).</p>

<p>“God speaks to Solomon” also means that the Lord ratifies him as King of Israel. Solomon’s request pleases God because it is made in humility, and has, as its object, not material things, but discernment or wisdom to administer justice among the people.</p>

<p>It’s a foretaste of all the order which, according to Christ’s teaching, the prayer of petition should have.</p>

<p>In one of the Catechisms, it says, “The Master and Lord of all things himself taught and commanded what is to be asked of God, and in what order it should be done. For since prayer indicates and expresses our desires and petitions, then we ask properly and with method; and the order of the petitions follows the order of the things that are to be desired.</p>

<p>“Now, true charity teaches us to direct our whole life and to drive desires to God, who, being the supreme Good, must of necessity be loved with a supreme and special love. And God cannot be loved heartily and exclusively if his glory and honor are not preferred to all things in creation. For all goods of our own and those of others, and in short, all that is designated by the name of good, must be subordinated to the supreme Good as coming from him” (Pope Pius V, <em>The Catechism of the Council of Trent</em>).</p>

<p>From Solomon, we can learn to look again at the things that we ask of God. Often they may be material favors: things we want, things that will suit our own comfort.</p>

<p>But Our Lord is telling us that it’s very pleasing to Him if we ask for things—gifts, talents—whereby we may be of greater service to our people. “He asked for wisdom to judge my people well” (<em>cf</em>. 1 Kings 3:9).</p>

<p>It’s good to ask God for those gifts that only He can give, all the graces that we need to be a better person, a better follower of Christ, a person of greater interior life, a person of greater virtue, greater charity, greater humility, greater order; whatever it is those virtues are that we need most—maybe purity and chastity, maybe prudence, maybe justice—so that we might fill ourselves with those good things (<em>cf</em>. Eph. 1:23), so that I can be a better student, a better parent, a better mother, a better father.</p>

<p>Wisdom can be defined as “knowledge of things through their ultimate causes” (Aristotle, <em>Posterior Analytics</em>). It’s wisdom to see only good and beauty in all things, because wisdom sees God’s beauty in everything and goes to serve others.</p>

<p>“True wisdom is a participation in the mind of God” (John Paul II, <em>Audience</em>, Jan. 29, 2003). Wisdom is a divine gift and a guide of life and of the decisions of the faithful. It gives us a loving knowledge of God and of people and created things insofar as they refer to Him.</p>

<p>As someone said once, “You get knowledge in college, but wisdom comes from God.” You may have an experience some time of speaking to somebody who perhaps does not have too much education but often their words express a wisdom that is uncommon, a wisdom that can only have come from the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>Sometimes we get wisdom in the course of life. Sometimes we don’t. But it’s enlightening and inspiring to listen to people that God may place in our path who may be full of wisdom, in spite of having very little opportunity in which to acquire it.</p>

<p>Through the gift of wisdom, the Holy Spirit places this knowledge within the reach of simple souls who love God. We’re told in St. Matthew: “I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to babes” (Matt. 11:25).</p>

<p>It’s a knowledge not learned from books but given by God who illumines and fills our mind and heart, will and understanding with love. By means of this light of love, the Christian has a more intimate and joyful knowledge of God and His mysteries.</p>

<p>There’s a Chinese proverb that says, “A single conversation across the table with a wise man is worth a month’s study of books.” In the course of our life, we have to try and gather wisdom to use our time well, to practice the virtue of humility, to give a lot of importance to our ongoing formation.</p>

<p>Fulton Sheen liked to say, “Just as a mouse eating piano keys cannot understand how someone can sit at a piano stool and play Tchaikovsky, so we do not understand the wisdom of God’s ways” (Fulton J. Sheen, <em>A Word to the Intelligentsia</em>).</p>

<p>Through the world of nature and of grace, the Holy Spirit enables us to perceive and contemplate the infinite wisdom, power, and goodness of God. His nature is reflected in created things.</p>

<p>Through this gift a Christian perceives and understands that, as St. Josemaría says in <em>Christ Is Passing By</em>, “all creation, the movement of the earth and the other heavenly bodies, the good actions of creatures and all the good that has been achieved in history, in short, everything, comes from God and is directed towards him” (Josemaría Escrivá, <em>Christ Is Passing By</em>, Point 130).</p>

<p>The Book of Wisdom says, Truly he will be able to say that wisdom “guided him on straight paths; she showed him the kingdom of God, and gave him knowledge of the angels” (Wisd. 10:10).</p>

<p>The Holy Spirit Himself will warn us when what is good and true in itself is in danger of becoming bad by leading us away from our last supernatural end. It could be a disordered desire for material possessions, or an attachment to these goods in a way that does not leave the heart free to serve God.</p>

<p>Christians who must sanctify themselves in the middle of the world have a particular need of this gift so as to direct all temporal activities to God, making them a means of holiness and apostolate.</p>

<p>Through it a housewife discovers how her work at home is a way to God if it is done with an upright, honest intention and with a desire to please God; a student learns that study is the ordinary way to love God, to do apostolate, and to serve society; for an architect the way to God is through plans and drawings; for a nurse, her care of the sick.</p>

<p>We understand that we must love the world and temporal affairs, and come to discover the truth of those words of St. Josemaría in<em>Conversations</em>, Point 114:</p>

<p>“There is something holy, something divine, hidden in the most ordinary situations, and it is up to each one of you to discover it” (J. Escrivá, Homily, “Passionately Loving the World” in <em>Conversations</em>, Point 114).</p>

<p>We have to try and apply this truth about the gift of wisdom to our ordinary Christian vocation in the middle of the world, to our interior life, to our apostolate, our work, our spiritual direction, our sacraments.</p>

<p>St. Josemaría says in <em>Conversations</em>, “When a Christian carries out with love the most insignificant everyday action, that action overflows with the transcendence of God. That is why I have told you repeatedly, and hammered away once and again at the idea, that the Christian vocation consists in making heroic verse out of the prose of each day” (J. Escrivá, <em>Conversations</em>, Point 116).</p>

<p>The epic poetry that we men and women write for God is composed of the ordinary events of the day, the problems and joys that we meet along our way.</p>

<p>Like Solomon, we have to ask for the wisdom to judge well. “Age doesn’t always bring wisdom; sometimes age comes alone” (attributed to Oscar Wilde).</p>

<p>In the <em>Furrow</em>, Point 38, St. Josemaría says, “It is no use trying to please everyone. There will always be people who disagree, who complain. The way popular wisdom sums it up is: ‘What is good for the sheep is bad for the wolves.’”</p>

<p>In an Encyclical called “Faith and Reason,” one of the greatest Encyclicals of John Paul II, he says, “Another of the great insights of St. Thomas was his perception of the role of the Holy Spirit in the process by which knowledge matures into wisdom. From the first pages of his <em>Summa Theologiae</em>, Aquinas was keen to show the primacy of the wisdom which is the gift of the Holy Spirit and which opens the way to a knowledge of divine realities.</p>

<p>“His theology allows us,” he continues, “to understand what is distinctive of wisdom in its close link with faith and knowledge of the divine. This wisdom comes to know by way of connaturality; it presupposes faith and eventually formulates its right judgment on the basis of the truth of faith itself.</p>

<p>‘The wisdom named among the gifts of the Holy Spirit is distinct from the wisdom found among the intellectual virtues. This second wisdom is acquired through study, but the first ‘comes from on high,’ as St. James puts it (James 3:17). This also distinguishes it from faith, since faith accepts divine truth as it is. But the gift of wisdom enables judgment according to divine truth” (John Paul II, Encyclical, <em>Fides et Ratio</em>, Point 44, September 14, 1998).</p>

<p>The Holy Father continues, “It is no accident that when the sacred author comes to describe the wise man, he portrays him as one who loves and seeks the truth: ‘Happy the man who meditates on wisdom and reasons intelligently, who reflects in his heart on her ways and ponders her secrets. He pursues her like a hunter and lies in wait on her paths. He peers through her windows and listens at her doors. He camps near her house and fastens his tent-peg to her walls. He pitches his tent near her and so finds an excellent resting place; he places his children under her protection and lodges under her boughs; by her he is sheltered from the heat and he dwells in the shade of her glory’” (Sir. 14:20-27 in <em>Fides et Ratio</em>, Point 16).</p>

<p>St. Paul to the Colossians says, “The treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden in Christ” (Col. 2:3). The closer we become to Christ in our interior life, in our presence of God, among the ordinary daily realities of our ordinary existence, the more we’re going to find those treasures of wisdom and knowledge.</p>

<p>One writer said, “Some people drink at the fountain of knowledge; other people just gargle.”</p>

<p>The Book of Proverbs says, “A fool takes pleasure in doing wrong; the intelligent, in cultivating wisdom” (Prov. 10:23).</p>

<p>We could ask Our Lord God for that grace to learn how to cultivate that wisdom on a daily basis—in our spiritual reading, in our cultural formation, in all the things that we’re exposed to, in our conversations with people, in our openness to new knowledge and new things.</p>

<p>St. Paul says to the Romans, “How rich and deep are the wisdom and the knowledge of God! We cannot reach to the root of his decisions or his ways” (Rom. 11:33).</p>

<p>The Book of Proverbs says, “For Yahweh himself is the giver of wisdom. From his mouth issue knowledge and understanding” (Prov. 2:6).</p>

<p>The Book of Wisdom itself says, “Wisdom will never enter the soul of a wrongdoer, nor dwell in a body enslaved to sin” (Wisd. 1:4).</p>

<p>In the Gospel, Our Lord encourages us to find wisdom in daily life. We’re told, “What does it profit a man if he gains the whole world but loses his own soul?” (Mark 8:36).</p>

<p>Augustine says, “Our hearts are restless, Lord, until they rest in you” (St. Augustine, <em>Confessions</em>).</p>

<p>St. Paul says, “For I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified” (1 Cor. 2:2).</p>

<p>How do we acquire the gift of wisdom? Like the other gifts of the Holy Spirit, it accompanies sanctifying grace, makes a person well disposed to receive inspirations and movements of the Holy Spirit, and “completes and perfects the virtues of those who receive them” (<em>Catechism of the Catholic Church</em>, Point 1831).</p>

<p>“The spiritual person,” we’re told by St. Paul, “can assess the value of everything, and that person’s value cannot be assessed by anybody else” (1 Cor. 2:15).</p>

<p>We ask for the gift of wisdom, not only for special undertakings, but to follow God’s will, which is a continuous task for the Christian.</p>

<p>Beneath the surface of things, when we follow the Holy Family closely in the different decisions they had to make, we see how they were trying to follow God’s will in a deep way: the journey to Bethlehem, the fleeing into Egypt, the coming back to Nazareth.</p>

<p>“This discernment,” we’re told, “is nourished by the light and strength of the Holy Spirit, who evokes everywhere and in all circumstances, obedience to the faith, the joyous courage of following Jesus, and the gift of wisdom, which ‘judges all things and is judged by no one’ (<em>cf</em>. 1 Cor. 2:15). It rests on the fidelity of the Father to his promises” (John Paul II, Apostolic Exhortation, <em>Pastores dabo vobis</em>, Point 10, March 25, 1992).</p>

<p>Through this gift, we share in Christ’s love for the people we’re in contact with. It’s relevant for our apostolate.</p>

<p>Through this gift, we see in our dealings with other people a chance to be more merciful, doing an effective apostolate, and bringing them closer to God.</p>

<p>We understand better the great need that men have to be helped on their way to Christ. Others are seen as persons in need of God, and that’s the way that Jesus sees them.</p>

<p>This gift teaches us to view events in the light of the providence of God, who is always a loving Father.</p>

<p>In <em>Christ Is Passing By,</em> Point 133, we’re told, “Among the gifts of the Holy Spirit, I would say there is one that we all need in a special way: the gift of wisdom. It makes us know God and rejoice in his presence, thereby placing us in a perspective from which we can judge accurately the situations and events of life.”</p>

<p>With the vision that this gift bestows, the soul who wishes to follow Christ closely contemplates reality from a higher perspective, because it shares in some way in the vision which God Himself has of Creation. Everything is judged with the clarity given by this gift.</p>

<p>Illumined by this gift, the saints have understood the real meaning of the events of this life, whether small or great.</p>

<p>They don’t consider illness a misfortune, nor do they rail against the sufferings they endure, because they understand that God blesses them in different ways, and frequently He blesses with the Cross.</p>

<p>Through this gift, the motions of grace will bring us and our friends and neighbors a great peace. We’ll be helped to bring joy wherever we go, and to find the right word to reconcile those who are at odds with one another. This gift ties in with the beatitude: “Blessed are the peacemakers” (Matt. 5:9).</p>

<p>Those who have peace in themselves can bring peace to others. This peace which the world cannot give (John 14:27) results from seeing all within the providential plan of God, who never for a moment forgets His children.</p>

<p>In <em>Friends of God</em>, it says, “May the Mother of God and Our Mother protect us, so that each one of us may serve the Church in the fullness of faith, with the gifts of the Holy Spirit, and with our contemplative life. May each of us joyfully honor the Lord by carrying out his duties, those which are properly his; each one of us, in his job or profession, and fulfilling the obligations of his state in life” (J. Escrivá, <em>Friends of God,</em> Point 316).</p>

<p>Queen of Apostles, pray for us and with us, so that the Holy Spirit will descend in abundance upon His Church, and that she will shine throughout the world, ever more united, holy, catholic, and apostolic.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

Conor Donnelly</p>

<p><em>(Proofread)</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here. That you see me, that you hear me.</em></p>

<p><em>I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins, and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful.</em></p>

<p><em>My immaculate mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>John Fisher was ordained a priest in 1491. He held several teaching posts at the University of Cambridge, and at the same time was responsible for the spiritual direction of Queen Margaret, the mother of Henry VIII. He later occupied the chair of theology which the queen had endowed at Cambridge.</p>

<p>Early in 1504, he was named Vice Chancellor of Cambridge University, and at the end of the year was consecrated Bishop of Rochester, the smallest and poorest diocese in England.</p>

<p>Two days later, he was appointed to office as a member of the King’s Council. Thomas More studied literature and philosophy at Oxford and law at the New Inn. In 1504, he was elected a member of parliament and held several public offices. He earned great prestige because of his knowledge of the law and his integrity.</p>

<p>Although his professional life was intensely time-consuming, he always found time for his family, which was his most important concern, and for his literary and historical studies. He published various books and essays. In 1529, he was appointed Lord Chancellor of England, in spite of having made it clear to the King that he would not agree to the dissolution of the King’s marriage.</p>

<p>Taking a full interest in the problems of his day, he dedicated himself to his work with the desire of implementing the laws and institutions of his times with a Christian approach. Both men were beheaded in 1535 for refusing to recognize the supremacy of Henry VIII over the Church in England and the annulment of the King’s marriage.</p>

<p>In England in 1534, all citizens who had come of age were ordered to take the oath unto the Act of Succession, which acknowledged the union of Henry VIII with Anne Boleyn as a marriage. The King proclaimed himself supreme head of the Church in England and denied any authority to the Pope. John Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, and Thomas More, Chancellor of the Realm, both refused to take the oath. They were imprisoned in 1534 and were beheaded the following year.</p>

<p>At a time when many acceded to the royal will, it would scarcely have been noticed if these two had taken the oath. They would have saved their lives, their property, their positions, as so many others did. Both of these men, however, were true to the faith, even to the point of martyrdom.</p>

<p>They were able to give their lives when the time came, because they were of the kind who lived their vocation day by day, giving daily witness to the faith, sometimes in matters that might have seemed of little or no consequence.</p>

<p>Thomas More is a man very close to ourselves because he was an ordinary Christian who knew how to combine, in perfect unity of life, his vocation as the father of a family, with his profession as a lawyer, and later as Lord Chancellor of England. He was at home in the world. He loved all the human realities that formed the framework of his life in the place and position where God wanted him to be.</p>

<p>At the same time, he lived such detachment from earthly things and had such love for the Cross that we can say he drew all of his strength from it. He was in the habit of meditating on a passage of the passion of Our Lord every Friday. When his children or his wife complained about ordinary difficulties and annoyances, he told them they could not expect to go to heaven on feather beds.</p>

<p>He reminded them of the sufferings Our Lord had undergone and that the servant is not greater than his master. As well as using the ordinary little pin pricks and routine mishaps of the day as a means of identifying himself with the Cross, More offered up other penances.</p>

<p>Some days he wore a hair shirt, a garment of rough cloth next to his skin. One writer says he continued this practice during his imprisonment in the Tower of London, in spite of the cold, the damp, and all the privations he had to put up with during those long months. It was here in the Cross that he found his strength.</p>

<p>We are Christians who follow Christ closely in the midst of the world and bear witness to Him, generally silently. We can ask ourselves also, do we find strength in being detached from earthly things and through the daily practice of mortification, penance, and prayer.</p>

<p>When Thomas More had to resign his post as Lord Chancellor, he gathered his family together to talk to them about the future that awaited them and how they would manage financially. He summarized his whole career, saying, “I have been brought up at Oxford, at the Inn of Chancery, at Lincoln’s Inn, and also at the King’s Court. From the lowest to the highest. Yet I now have little above one hundred pounds a year. If we are to continue together, all must become contributors. But my counsel is that it shall not be best for us to fall to the lowest fare first.”</p>

<p>Then he suggested to them a gradual descent, reminding them how it is possible to be content at every level. One writer says, if they were unable to support themselves at even the lowest level, that one at which he had managed to live while in Oxford, he said with peace and good humor, “Then we may yet with bags and wallets go a-begging together, and hoping for, for pity, some good folks will give us of their charity, and so still keep company and be merry together.” He never allowed anything to disturb the unity and peace of his family, even when he was away or in prison.</p>

<p>He lived detached from things when he had them, and with great joy when he did not possess or even have access to even the most indispensable necessities of life. He was always able to rise above circumstances. He knew how to celebrate important events even behind prison bars. A contemporary biographer tells us that while he was imprisoned in the Tower, he would dress more elegantly on important feast days, so far as his meager wardrobe would permit. He always remained cheerful and good-humored, even at the moment when he was ascending the scaffold, because he relied firmly on prayer.</p>

<p>“Good Lord, the things that I pray for,” he said, “give me your grace to labor for.” He did not expect God to give him those things that, with just a little effort on his part, he could obtain for himself. He worked all his life so as to become a lawyer of great prestige before being appointed Lord Chancellor. He never forgot, however, the need for prayer. Even though at times, and particularly in circumstances as dramatic as those leading up to his execution, it was not easy for him.</p>

<p>During those days, he wrote a long prayer in which many of the pious and moving considerations made by a man who knew he was about to die. He exclaimed, “Grant me, my Lord, a desire to be with you, not so as to avoid the calamities of this world, nor even to avoid the pains of purgatory, nor those of hell, nor to gain the joys of heaven, not out of consideration for my own profit, but simply through true love for you.”</p>

<p>St. Thomas More is always presented to us as a man of prayer. St. Josemaría says in <em>The Furrow</em>, “This enabled him to be faithful whatever the circumstances, to his commitments as a citizen and as a Christian. Thereby living a perfect unity of life. This is how we too have to be. A Catholic without prayer is the same as a soldier without arms.” We could ask ourselves, well how is my relationship with Christ?</p>

<p>Do I try to grow each day in intimacy with Him? Does my prayer influence the rest of my day? He prayed, “Give me the grace, Good Lord, to set the world at naught. To have my mind well united to you. To not depend on the changing opinions of others. So that I may think joyfully of God, and tenderly implore your help. So that I may lean on God’s strength and make an effort to love Him. So as to thank Him ceaselessly for His benefits. So as to redeem the time I have wasted.”</p>

<p>The saint wrote these words in the margin of the Book of Hours he had with him in the Tower of London. They were days in which he gave himself over completely to contemplating the Passion, and in this way to preparing himself for his own death in union with the death Christ suffered on the cross.</p>

<p>Saint Thomas’s last moments on earth were seen not only by God. His love for God had been clear to everyone around him, day by day in his family life, in his simple, pleasant manner, in the way he carried out his profession as a lawyer, in holding the highest post in the land, that of Lord Chancellor.</p>

<p>It was through fulfilling the duties of each day, some of which were important, others less important, that he sanctified himself and helped others to find God. Among many other examples of his effective apostolate, he has left us that of the apostolate he did with his son-in-law, who had fallen into the Lutheran heresy.</p>

<p>He said to his daughter, “I have borne a long time with your husband. I have reasoned and argued with him on these points of religion, and given to him my poor fatherly counsel, but I perceive none of this is able to call him home, and therefore, Meg, I will no longer dispute with him, but will give him over, and get me to God to pray for him.”</p>

<p>More’s words and prayers were effective, as soon afterwards, Roper returned to the fullness of the faith and afterwards suffered much through remaining loyal to the Catholic faith. Saint Thomas More remains among us as a living example for our conduct as Christians. He is the fruitful seed of peace and joy.</p>

<p>As was his passage on earth, at home among his family and friends, in the law courts, in the university chair, at court, in the embassies, in parliament, and in government. He is also a silent patron of England who shed his blood in defense of the unity of the Church and of the spiritual power of the Vicar of Christ.</p>

<p>One writer says, “As the blood of Christians is a germinating seed, the blood of Thomas More slowly seeps into and soaks the souls of those who approach him, drawn by his prestige, his sweetness of character, and his strength. More will be the silent apostle of the return to the faith of a whole nation.”</p>

<p>We can ask John Fisher and Thomas More to teach us to imitate them in their Christian coherence, so that we may live as God wants us to in all things, both great and small, whatever the circumstances of our lives. The opening prayer of today’s Mass says, “In the death of your martyrs, O God, we see the noblest of testimonies to the true faith. Grant we pray that strengthened by the prayers of Saint Thomas More and Saint John Fisher, we may bear witness in our lives to the faith we confess with our lips.”</p>

<p>When we contemplate the lives of these great saints, also of the English-speaking world, we could note the first necessary step in persevering to the end of the way: that desire of wanting to be a saint. We could ask them for those real and effective desires. The psalms we read, “My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. As a deer longs for flowing streams, so longs my soul for you, O God. When shall I come and behold the face of God?” (Ps. 42:2–3).</p>

<p>The deer attempting to quench its thirst with water is the psalmist’s symbolic way of describing the desire for God present in the heart of an upright person. A thirst and vehement desire for God. Such is the aspiration of one who is not content to accept worldly success as the satisfaction for human ambitions. We’re told in Saint Matthew’s Gospel, “What will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his life?” (Matt. 16:26).</p>

<p>Our Lord’s question forces us to take a radical look at the broad horizon of our life to which only God gives ultimate meaning. “My soul thirsts for God.” Saint Josemaría says, “The saints are not abnormally gifted people, nor have they necessarily been completely perfect since childhood. They are men and women with a great desire to belong to God completely, despite their defects.” We could each ask ourselves, “Have I a true desire to be a saint?”</p>

<p>The answer most assuredly would be in the affirmative, yes. But our reply should not be as to a theoretical question, he says, “Because for some, holiness is unattainable, something to do with ascetical theology, but not a real goal, a living reality.”</p>

<p>“We want to make it happen with the help of God’s grace. So longs my soul for you, O God.” We have to start by making the desire for holiness flourish in our own soul, telling Our Lord, “I want to be a saint, or at least when I experience my softness and weakness, I want to want to be a saint.”</p>

<p>To banish doubt and make holiness more than an empty word, we need to turn and look at Christ. The Second Vatican Council says, “The Lord Jesus, the divine teacher and model of all perfection, preached holiness of life, of which he is the author and maker, to each and every one of his disciples without distinction” (Lumen Gentium, 40).</p>

<p>“You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect” (Matt. 5:48). He has taken the initiative. If He had not, the possibility of being a saint would never have occurred to us. Jesus put it to us as a command, “Be perfect.” It is not surprising that the Church makes sure her children hear these resounding words.</p>

<p>Therefore, all the faithful, says the Second Vatican Council, are invited and obliged to holiness and the perfection of their own state of life. Think then how deep our desire for holiness has to be. In Scripture, the prophet Daniel is “a man of desires” (Dan. 9:23).</p>

<p>It would be wonderful if we were all worthy of such a title. The first thing that souls must do if they embark on the path of holiness, says St. Teresa, is really to want to be saints, whatever may come, whatever may happen to them, however hard they may have to labor, whoever may complain of them, whether they reach their goal or die on the road.</p>

<p>In <em>The Furrow</em>, we’re told, “Allow your soul to be consumed by desires, desires for loving, for forgetting yourself, for sanctity, for heaven. Do not stop to wonder whether the time will come for seeing them accomplished, as some pseudo-advisor might suggest. Make them more fervent each day, for the Holy Spirit says that He is pleased with men of desires.”</p>

<p>“Let your desires be operative and put them into practice in your daily tasks.” We should examine our conscience to see if our desires for holiness are sincere and effective, and furthermore to see if we take them as something obligatory for a faithful Christian, as the Second Vatican Council states, in response to God’s desires.</p>

<p>This response could reveal the reason for so much apathy and weakness in our interior struggle. In <em>The Way</em>, we’re told, “You tell me yes, you want to. Very good, but do you want to as a miser longs for gold, as a mother loves her child, as a worldling craves for honors, or as a wretched sensualist seeks his pleasure?”</p>

<p>“No, then you don’t really want to.” We could try to develop these desires with the virtue of hope. One can only effectively desire something when there is a hope of attaining it. If we consider some aim to be impossible and not for us, we will not really desire it. Our theological hope rests on God.</p>

<p>Softness and lukewarmness can destroy our desires for holiness. There is need for vigilance. The conversion of Cornelius the Centurion, mentioned in today’s Mass, in the first reading, shows that God is no respecter of persons. Saint Peter explains to the others what has happened. The Holy Spirit, we’re told in the Acts, “fell upon them just as on us at the beginning” (Acts 11:15).</p>

<p>There are no limits or barriers to the power of the Holy Spirit. This is true in our case, just as it was for Cornelius, who was not a Jew by race or nation. On the one hand, we have to want to be saints, but we must also take into account that we’re told in the Psalms that, “Unless the Lord builds the house, those who build it labor in vain” (Ps. 127:1).</p>

<p>Humility leads us to count always above all on God’s grace. To this we add our efforts to acquire virtues and practice them continuously, and our apostolic zeal, since our concept of personal holiness should not be one which ignores others or which is indifferent to charity. That would be contradictory.</p>

<p>There is our desire to be with Christ on the Cross. That is, to be mortified, not rejecting sacrifice in small things, and if need be in big things. We should be forewarned about approaching God with reservations and without renunciation, trying to make the love of God compatible with what is not pleasing to Him.</p>

<p>We should be alert in developing our desires for holiness continually through prayer, by asking God for the ability to struggle each day, to discover in our examination of conscience the places where our love is growing cold. Saint John of the Cross says, “Desire for holiness is real when we fulfill acts of piety with refinement, not omitting them or delaying them for any reason whatever, refusing to be led by our moods and feelings.”</p>

<p>Because the soul truly in love with God never fails through laziness to do all in its power to seek God’s Son the Beloved. And having done all it could, is still not satisfied as it thinks it has done nothing. The virtue of humility enables us to avoid a sense of self-satisfaction with what we have done, and not to be content with ineffectual desires.</p>

<p>It lets us see how we can do more to show the sincerity of our desires with deeds of love, ensuring that our sins, offenses, and negligences don’t frustrate our expectations. Humility doesn’t clip the wings of our desires, but rather helps us to understand the need to have recourse to God to make them come true. With God’s grace, we can do all in our power to make virtue grow in our soul by removing obstacles, fleeing from occasions of sin, and bravely resisting temptations. We should avoid discouragement in the struggle to improve.</p>

<p>We have to count on time and on God’s grace. “My soul thirsts for God, for the living God” (Ps. 42:2). St. Josemaría says, “Is this thirst compatible with our experience of our defects and even our falls? Yes, because saints are not those who have never sinned, but those who have always got up again.” Refusal to pursue holiness and seeing ourselves full of defects is a hidden form of pride and obvious cowardice which will end up stifling our desires for God. “Feeling easily deflated,” says St. Josemaría, “and lying down under adversity is characteristic of cowardly souls lacking the firm virtue of trusting in God’s promises.”</p>

<p>Abandoning God, ceasing to struggle because of our defects when there is opposition is a serious mistake. A very subtle and dangerous temptation, which can lead us to that form of pride called pusillanimity, lack of courage and strength to bear misfortune or undertake large enterprises. We may need to rid ourselves of false illusions in wanting to be saints in a day. That would be impossible, unless God decided to perform a miracle, which He has no reason to do, since He gives us all the graces we need by ordinary means in a continuous and progressive way.</p>

<p>One writer says, “An effective desire for holiness consists in a conscious and determined effort to use the necessary means to attain holiness.” If desire is lacking, nothing can be done. One doesn’t even try. Desires alone are not enough. We must be patient then, and not try to banish in a day the many habits we have picked up in neglecting our spiritual health. “As the deer longs for flowing streams, so my soul longs for you, O God” (Ps. 42:1). We could almost hear those words on the lips and heart of St. Thomas More and Bishop John Fisher.</p>

<p>Let us try to keep our desire for God alive, to enkindle the flame of faith and hope in the fire of the love of God, enlivening our virtues and burning away our miseries. We will quench our thirst for holiness with the water that springs up to eternal life. And always our mother will be there to help us.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice.

Conor Donnelly</p>

<p>(<em>Proofread</em>)</p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>“Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the desert, to be tempted by the devil. And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, afterwards he was hungry. And the tempter coming said to him: ‘If you be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.’ He answered and said: ‘It is written: not in bread alone does man live, but in every word that proceeds from the mouth of God’” (Matt. 4:1-4).</p>

<p>We find the devil mentioned very strongly in this particular moment of the Gospel.</p>

<p>Some people tend to laugh at the very suggestion of the existence of the devil, but his presence in Scripture and in the <em>Catechism of the Catholic Church</em> is very clear. Often, it’s his most powerful weapon that people ignore him, and so he acts like a thief. But he exists and he tempted Christ.</p>

<p>He is the enemy of our redemption. He tempted and made our first parents sin. He disobeyed God and is eager to get man to do the same. He’s envious of the relationship between man and God and seeks to destroy it. Our Lord talks a lot about him, and so we can’t ignore him.</p>

<p>We have a lot of faith in God. It’s good also that we have faith in the devil. But the fact that he tempts us and bothers us on a daily basis doesn’t mean that we need to lose our peace, because we count on the help of Our Father God.</p>

<p>We can always be positive in our fight. We need not look on temptation as a burden. Our Lord Himself underwent temptation. We overcome temptation. We don’t undergo temptation.</p>

<p>We can also count on the fact that in the face of temptation we are never alone. We have the Communion of Saints.</p>

<p>Our Lord wants us in these moments to acknowledge our humility, our weakness, and to run with more intensity to prayer and flee from the occasions; at the same time, counting on them, because they are part of the way to sanctity.</p>

<p>Our Lord has already triumphed. We have all the means. We can unite ourselves to His victory.</p>

<p>Every temptation that we overcome strengthens our soul and increases our grace.</p>

<p>Our Lord often was alone in solitude with God. His praying reminds us of the need we too have, to often seek those moments of solitude where we can be alone with God and pray.</p>

<p>“Count it all for joy,” says St. James, “when you fall into different temptations. Knowing that the trying of your faith works patience” (James 1:2-3).</p>

<p>There are many times in Scripture where the benefit of temptation is mentioned.</p>

<p>“Blessed is the person,” also says St. James, “that endures temptation; for when he has been proven he shall receive the crown of life” (James 1:12). Temptation is a pathway to glory and to victory.</p>

<p>St. Paul says, “He that thinks himself strong enough to stand, let him take heed lest he fall” (1 Cor. 10:12).</p>

<p>“God is faithful,” says St. Paul, “who will not suffer you to be tempted above what you’re able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that you may be able to bear it” (1 Cor. 10:13).</p>

<p>The devil is the father of lies (John 8:44). Lying is behaving like a child of Satan.</p>

<p>But when we realize that we’ve invited the devil into our house or that he’s cornered us in his cave, our response has to be to run back to God with an act of contrition. Those acts of contrition can be a constant in our life.</p>

<p>Did Jesus need to be tempted? Could He be tempted?</p>

<p>In some ways He didn’t need to be tempted. He was the God-Man. But by allowing Himself to be tempted by the devil, He instructs us how to overcome those temptations.</p>

<p>Tempting means testing: trying to improve something one is not sure about. It involves the possibility that the results may go one way or another.</p>

<p>As God, Jesus could not be tempted, but the devil did not know or was not sure that He was God. It’s unlikely that the devil knew about the doctrine of the Blessed Trinity, which was first revealed to Our Lady. As God-Man, there’s no possibility of failing the test. The devil did not know this.</p>

<p>Why did the God-Man agree to this Himself?</p>

<p>Not to be strengthened, as we might need due to weakness, but it was for our instruction that He allowed Himself to be tempted as we will be tempted and tested. And that testing is not bad; otherwise, He would not have agreed to it. Great benefit can come from that.</p>

<p>St. Padre Pio said that if we knew the merit that comes from overcoming temptation, we would welcome temptations (<em>cf</em>. Padre Pio, <em>Epistolario</em>).</p>

<p>There’s a great good to be gained from it. If we are to be like Him, we will go through the same.</p>

<p>If we are trying to lead holy lives, it’s very logical that the devil will try to knock us off our perch. We’re a big target for him. He wins a great battle if he can bring us down.</p>

<p>Our Lord has come to overcome the devil. The purpose of the Incarnation in some ways was to undo all the evil that the devil had done. St. John says this in his Letter: it was “to undo all that the devil has done that the Son of God appeared” (1 John 3:8).</p>

<p>It’s appropriate that Christ arranges a meeting with the devil, a duel, so that His overcoming Satan will be a pledge to our future success. It was truly a battle of the giants.</p>

<p>In the first temptation, we’re told that the devil tempted Jesus to eat bread: “Turn these stones into loaves of bread” (Matt. 4:3).</p>

<p>After forty days, Our Lord must have been really hungry, as anyone would be. The devil picks Him out at His weakest moment, and that’s what he does to us also.</p>

<p>Now, the Lord answers him with a phrase from Scripture: “Man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds from the mouth of God” (Matt. 4:4; Deut. 8:3).</p>

<p>It’s a reminder that we are on this journey ourselves, and we also have to rely on the word of God.</p>

<p>Christ doesn’t reject or disclaim that He’s hungry, but He raises the matter to a higher level.</p>

<p>We could also remind ourselves that He is truly the Word of God and He is going to give us the Bread of Life, one of the means to overcome all temptation.</p>

<p>Christ gives us the means. He’s there with us at every moment; He doesn’t leave us alone with the devil. He’s going to give us that Eternal Bread.</p>

<p>The first temptation is a temptation to do things for our own advantage only: “turn these stones into bread.” Eat. The test is on the passions and the needs of the body. Temptation is to care only for the passing food and forget about the eternal Word.</p>

<p>“Do not labor for the food that perishes, but for that which endures to eternal life” (John 6:27). It’s a temptation to rely on one’s own strength, but happiness of life has an eternal dimension.</p>

<p>There are three stages of temptation. There’s suggestion, there’s complacency, and there’s consent. Mortal sin only exists at the level of consent.</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter how many suggestions we may have on a daily basis—to our purity, to our laziness, to our disorder, to our charity, to our obedience, our vanity, our pride, our selfishness—as long as we try not to consent to them.</p>

<p>All the most important people in sacred history have been tempted: Adam, Eve, Abraham, Moses, Peter, and Paul.</p>

<p>By rejecting the temptations of the devil, Our Lord atones for the faults of those who went before Him and those who will come after. His reaction is an example for all the temptations we may have, to greed, to gluttony, to avarice.</p>

<p>He later teaches in the <em>Our Father</em> to ask God to help us with His grace not to fall into temptation: “Lead us not into temptation” (Matt. 6:13).</p>

<p>Before beginning His work as Messiah, Our Lord prepares by prayer and fasting. That’s what the forty days of Lent are all about. The devil makes use of this opportunity. As we begin our mission, we shouldn’t be surprised that the devil has a go at us.</p>

<p>He’s physically empty. This makes Him vulnerable. He could work a miracle, but it’s not part of God’s plan. He prefers to trust in His Father.</p>

<p>We also learn from this how we have to be careful in moments of vulnerability—when we’re low, when we’re tired, when we’re discouraged.</p>

<p>The devil seems to say to Him: How can you be the Son of God and still be hungry? How can your loving heavenly Father have allowed you to be hungry? How can He love you and yet permit this contradiction?</p>

<p>The devil may say the same thing to us in modern parlance: How can you be poor and yet still loved by your heavenly Father? Or unsuccessful? Or unemployed? Or a failure? Or have cancer? Or be in this concentration camp or this jail?</p>

<p>Or your child is in jail or has this incurable disease, and God still loves you? How can you be condemned to die with an incurable sickness? Or how can you have failed your driving test and God still loves you?</p>

<p>A lady came to me once from another country and said, “Father, why is God so cruel? Why does he treat me so roughly? Why does he hate me so much?”</p>

<p>I was wondering what terrible thing had happened in her life. And she said, “I’ve just failed my driving test for the eighth time!”</p>

<p>All the contradictions of life does not mean that God does not love us. We believe with faith that Our Heavenly Father is looking after us 24/7. We have every reason to reject these subtle temptations.</p>

<p>When the devil is stripped of all his disguises, the ultimate goal of the satanic is to avoid the Cross. To avoid self-denial. Avoid standing on our pride, on our selfishness, on our egoism. Avoid any form of mortification.</p>

<p>To this temptation Christ said, “Get behind me, Satan!” (Matt. 16:23).</p>

<p>The three temptations of Christ were worldly ways of avoiding the Cross. At the beginning of His public life, the devil tries to show Christ another way of saving the world.</p>

<p>The way that Our Lord answers the devil teaches us how to deal with temptation. He also teaches us that we shouldn’t ask God for things that we can obtain with our own efforts. God wants us to use the human means.</p>

<p>And we shouldn’t just ask Him for what is exclusively for our own convenience, but rather what will help towards our holiness and that of others.</p>

<p>Jesus says: I can be poor and still be loved. I can be loved and still be hungry. I can be blessed and still be empty. I can be precious to God and still unfulfilled.</p>

<p>He invites us to look to the Word of God for our fulfillment. “Not in bread alone does man live, but on every word that proceeds from the mouth of God” (Matt. 4:4).</p>

<p>It’s an act of trust in Fatherly Providence. God will not let Him die. He led Him to the desert to prepare Him for His mission.</p>

<p>St. Gregory the Great says if we consider how Our Lord let Himself be treated in the Passion, it’s not surprising that He let Himself be treated by the devil as He did (<em>cf</em>. Gregory I, <em>Homilies on the Gospels</em>, Homily 16). It’s all a preparation for what’s to come.</p>

<p>“Then the devil took him into the holy city and set him upon the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, ‘If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down; for it is written: He has given his angels charge over you, and in their hands they will bear you up, lest you dash your foot against the stone.’ Jesus said to him, ‘It is written again: You shall not tempt the Lord your God’” (Matt. 4:5-7; Deut. 6:16).</p>

<p>In the second temptation, the devil realizes that he hasn’t won the first time. Now he asks Him to enlist the help of the angels: “He has given his angels charge over you.” The devil quotes Sacred Scripture. Interesting.</p>

<p>The test now is the ego—to show that if one is powerful enough, that He can overcome all.</p>

<p>Christ responds, also quoting Scripture, telling him not to test God.</p>

<p>Every time we think we’re powerful enough to overcome an occasion of sin that we put ourselves in, we are testing God: ‘I’m strong enough to resist the temptation.’ ‘I can watch this movie.’ ‘I can look at this picture.’ ‘I can answer this call.’ ‘I can meet this person.’</p>

<p>When we can only find out, to our cost to us, we’re not as strong as we thought we were.</p>

<p>The Church teaches us to flee from occasions of sin. “If your hand is an occasion of sin to you, cut it off” (<em>cf</em>. Matt. 5:30).</p>

<p>Christ is very radical. He doesn’t say take one long, last, lingering, loving look at your hand, and then kiss your hand goodbye, and make sure that your hand feels very good about it. Christ said, “Cut it off.”</p>

<p>We can ask Our Lord for the fortitude to cut the temptations, to distance ourselves from the occasions of sin, the subtle ways in which the devil comes to us.</p>

<p>When he says to us: Don’t worry, you’re strong; you’re a child of God; nothing will happen; so many of your friends have done the same; you’re a good Christian of proven virtue; surely there’s no sin in entertaining yourself—God is there to help us. By the way, in case you forget, He has even sent His angel.</p>

<p>We have an angel to take care of us. He needs to occupy himself a little bit with our care. The devil says let him do the necessary.</p>

<p>The devil says, “He will send his angel so that you don’t get hurt” (<em>cf</em>. Matt. 4:6). But over and above all this, Our Lord says, “You should not tempt the Lord your God” (Matt. 4:7; Deut. 6:16).</p>

<p>We can fly to the care of the angels for our help in moments of temptation. The <em>Prayer to St. Michael</em> is a prayer the Church recommends to say every day, particularly after Mass, and in all dangers and temptations.</p>

<p>Or the <em>Memorare</em> prayer to Our Lady when we feel things are getting hot. It’s a very good prayer to teach your children to make them aware of the devil, and to see how we shouldn’t be asking Our Lord for extraordinary help, when He wants us to avoid the occasions of sin ourselves—to see where the devil may be lurking, to see where the dangers are, to be clever. “The prudent of this world must be children of the light, not children of darkness” (Luke 16:8).</p>

<p>We know that God will help us when there’s no other way, but God is not a remedy for our laziness or our refusal to try.</p>

<p>The whole of Lent reminds us of the importance of struggle. The Old Testament says, “The life of man on earth is a struggle” (<em>cf</em>. Job 7:1). God wants us to struggle like He struggled on the way to Calvary. He fell down three times, but He got up again.</p>

<p>In this temptation the devil quotes Scripture. He sets himself up as an interpreter of Scripture. It’s a reminder to us to reject any interpretation of Scripture that is not in keeping with the teaching of the Church, stressing certain passages to the exclusion of others.</p>

<p>The Magisterium of the Church, guided by the Holy Spirit, is the one divine interpreter of Sacred Scripture. “All power in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go you, therefore, teach all nations” (Matt. 28:18-19). It’s the teaching power of the Church, guided by the Holy Spirit, that gives us the truth that is in Scripture.</p>

<p>The second temptation is temptation to the spectacular, the extraordinary. “Cast yourself down from the pinnacle of the temple.” Throw yourself out into the air. Do this publicity stunt. Anything to draw the crowd. Be like Superman, Batman, Spiderman.</p>

<p>The devil can also say that to us: Forget the ordinary. Be immersed in the extraordinary. Look for all sorts of extraordinary things.</p>

<p>But we know from Scripture that the ordinary passes unnoticed, like Jesus in Nazareth.</p>

<p>Some people may only believe in God and in Our Lady when they see spectacular things, miracles, apparitions, when they hear God speaking through the crowds, or when they see stigmata.</p>

<p>But Jesus bids us to look for the extraordinary in the ordinary.</p>

<p>The life of a Christian, when he has faith—when he works, when he rests, when he prays—in all moments, is always supernatural. It’s a life in which God is always present with reason enlightened by faith.</p>

<p>Our Lord rejects the [second] temptation as He did the first: “You shall not tempt the Lord your God.”</p>

<p>To tempt God is the opposite of trusting Him. We shouldn’t ask Him for extraordinary help, putting ourselves in dangerous situations: diving off some cliff into the ocean; driving when we’ve taken a drink or two; dilly-dallying with occasions of sin, with certain movies, or our phone, or people—things that we know are a danger for us.</p>

<p>We all have different temptations, different weaknesses. One man’s meat can be another man’s poison. We have to know what we have to be careful with.</p>

<p>And then there is the third temptation. “Again, the devil took him up a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them, and said to him, ‘All these will I give you, if falling down you will adore me.’ And Jesus said to him, ‘Be gone, Satan! For it is written: The Lord your God shall you adore, and him only shall you serve.’ Then the devil left him; and behold, angels came and ministered to him” (Matt. 4:8-11).</p>

<p>The third temptation is a temptation to possessions, to have power and glory. He “showed him all the kingdoms of the world.” It’s a temptation to have material things, to social status, to power—temptation to have plenty of dreams of how great it would be to possess the world, or at least half of it.</p>

<p>But the Lord seems to say that happiness does not come from material possessions. It comes from choosing God; at times, choosing the cross, following the pathway of our Christian vocation. Not from doing things that are easy.</p>

<p>We only get momentary happiness from possessions or some material thing. But that is passing and can leave us with a bitter sadness, like that of the rich young man who “went his way sad, because he had great possessions” (Matt. 19:16-22). He clung to his riches.</p>

<p>He could have been an apostle. He could have been one of the great instruments that Our Lord used to build His Church, but he did not want.</p>

<p>Our Lord invites us to let our dreams be on what is necessary to lead a decent life. “Do not labor for the food that perishes, but for that which endures to eternal life” (John 6:27). The rest is from the evil one.</p>

<p>Don’t just focus on desiring riches, or success, or money, or power, or glory. Don’t be like people who actually adore Satan in his many forms.</p>

<p>Sometimes the devil keeps his word. He gives them riches. He provokes Christ to take on the role of an earthly Messiah, a pseudo-Messiah: Identify yourself with the world. Do what is popular. Worship me for I am its prince.</p>

<p>St. Paul says, “Do not conform your mind to the ways of this world” (Rom. 12:2).</p>

<p>Christ invites us to be different—at times to clash with our environment, to stick our neck out. To be a leader. To be a conscientious objector, if necessary. To be different to everybody else.</p>

<p>There was a Dutch missionary priest in Singapore who used to tell newly baptized adults in his parish every year—there were sixty of them—“Now that you’re Catholics you have to be different. You can’t be the same as everybody else, because we’ve come to change this world. A Christian has to stand out.”</p>

<p>The devil says to the apostle: Don’t be unpopular. Don’t be different from your colleagues. Don’t clash with your environment. Take it easy.</p>

<p>It’s a temptation to reduce the God-given transcendental mission to a purely human and political one. It’s a reminder to the Church and to each one to remain faithful to its God-given mission in the world.</p>

<p>Fulton Sheen used to say, “Whoever marries the spirit of the world in this generation becomes a widow in the next” (Fulton J. Sheen, <em>Sermon</em>, September 22, 1940).</p>

<p>Our Lord replies: “Be gone, Satan! For it is written, the Lord your God you shall adore and him only shall you serve” (Matt. 4:10; Deut. 6:13). There’s an uncompromising rejection of an earthly messianism. Our Lord rejects all human glory.</p>

<p>We’re reminded too that although God had the right to be treated as a God, He took the form of a slave. “He emptied himself” (Phil. 2:7).</p>

<p>We can learn from the attitude of Jesus in these trials. The absence of earthly glory and the blessings of God are not incompatible. If we struggle constantly, we’ll attain victory.</p>

<p>We’re told that “the devil left him and behold, angels came and ministered to him.” Nobody is crowned without having first conquered. The coming of the angels teaches us the interior joy given by God to the person who fights energetically.</p>

<p>Our guardian angels are powerful defenders against temptations. Teach your children to invoke their guardian angel every day.</p>

<p>It is the temptation to identify fidelity to God with success in the eyes of the world. It’s difficult to believe that we’re special and loved by God even when we’re hungry or empty or unfulfilled; when we’re not successful in the eyes of the world.</p>

<p>“We’re not tempted because we’re evil, but because we’re human. There’s nothing intrinsically evil about human nature just because the devil knocks at the door. Evil begins when we open the door and consent to the temptation. Scripture praises the man who suffers temptations.” Job went through many temptations. “When we resist temptation, we strengthen our character” (Fulton J. Sheen, <em>Life Is Worth Living).</em></p>

<p>We need to be careful with temptations so that we don’t fall away from our ideals—the ideals of holiness, of our vocation, the ideals of our apostolate. We’ve come to change the world.</p>

<p>Sometimes we could thank Our Lord for the temptations that He permits in our life. Helps us to know our weaknesses, where we need to struggle.</p>

<p>Our Lord allowed Himself to be tempted, so we can’t be surprised if we’re tempted also.</p>

<p>St. Paul says to Timothy: “He is not crowned, except he who strives lawfully” (2 Tim. 2:5). “Blessed is the person who endures temptation, for when he has been proven, he will receive the crown of life” (James 1:12).</p>

<p>Tried in temptation, virtue grows and increases in firmness (<em>cf</em>. Leo I, <em>Sermon 39</em>).</p>

<p>We know that Our Lady “crushed the head of the serpent” (Gen. 3:15). In moments of temptation, we can turn to Our Mother and ask her for all the strength that we need, to ask her for the help to realize that every urge, every craving is not necessarily a worthy one.</p>

<p>The drug addict hungers for their next high, but we know that all drugs in that sense are bad for you. Saying no to temptation seems to go against the go-for-it philosophy that many people in society promote.</p>

<p>Even our body and mind seem to fight as we deprive it of the fuel it hungers for, regardless of whether that fuel is good or bad for our spiritual and emotional welfare.</p>

<p>Mary, help me to see where my weaknesses lie, and to be wise and prudent to use that information to my best advantage.</p>

<p>The good news is that the more we say no to temptation and ungodly desires, the more we actually strengthen those weak spots. God doesn’t want us to run and hide from temptation, but to face it head on so that we may clearly see the potential pit before us.</p>

<p>Mary, help us to confess our sins, to admit our weaknesses, and to ask God for the strength and the wisdom we need to stand against all evil.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

Conor Donnelly</p>

<p><em>(Proofread)</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here. That you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My immaculate mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>After Jerusalem and Antioch, Rome was the most important early Christian nucleus. Many Christians came from the Jewish colony existing in Rome. The majority came over from paganism. Today we commemorate the Christians who underwent the first persecution against the church under the emperor Nero, after the destruction of Rome by fire.</p>

<p>The Christian faith had reached Rome very quickly, which was at that time the center of the civilized world. Perhaps the first Christians in the capital of the empire were converted Jews who had come across the faith in Jerusalem itself or in some cities of Asia Minor that had been evangelized by Saint Paul. The faith was passed on from friend to friend, between workmates and relatives. The arrival of Saint Peter in about the year 43 brought about a perceptible strengthening of the little Christian community that was there. From Rome, the new religion spread to many parts of the empire.</p>

<p>The internal peace enjoyed by the imperial world at that time, the improvements in communications that facilitated travel and the rapid transmission of ideas and news, all this favored the spreading of Christianity. The Roman roads that began in the city, the great city itself, reached the most remote corners of the empire. The commercial fleets that regularly crossed the waters of the Mediterranean all helped to spread the new Christian religion throughout the length and breadth of the Roman world.</p>

<p>It’s difficult to describe the process of conversion, the sequence of experience that affected each person who embraced Christianity in first century Rome, just as it is now. Because each conversion is always a miracle of grace and of personal correspondence with God’s gift of it.</p>

<p>There’s no doubt that a decisive influence was the good example given by the Christians. What Saint Paul calls the bonus odor Christi, the good odor of Christ, which had its repercussions in the way they worked, in their joy, their charity, and their understanding for everyone. In the austerity of their lives, and in their human likableness.</p>

<p>They were men and women who tried to live their faith fully in the midst of their ordinary activities. They were now to be found in all levels of society. Daniel was young and Joseph a slave. Aquila wrought a craft. The woman who sold purple dyestuffs supervised a busy workshop. Another was a prison governor. Another a centurion like Cornelius. Saint John Chrysostom says another was in ill health like Timothy. Another was a runaway from slavery like Onesimus. Nothing proved a hindrance to any of these, but all were joyously welcomed and accepted. Both men and women, both young and old, both slaves and free men, both soldiers and civilian citizens alike.</p>

<p>The Acts of the Apostles has left us a delightful account of the hospitality shown by the Christians in Rome. They tell of the welcome given to Paul when he was brought as a prisoner to the capital. The brethren there, Saint Luke informs us, “when they heard of this, came as far as the Forum of Appius and the Three Taverns to meet us. On seeing them, Paul thanked God and took courage” (Acts 28:15). Paul felt strengthened by these demonstrations of fraternal charity.</p>

<p>The first Christians did not give up their professional or social activities. Some people were to do so, with a specific call from God, rather more than two centuries later. With their lives and their words, they considered themselves very much part of this world. Of which they were convinced they were destined to be salt and light. An early Christian writer summed up saying Christians are to the world what the soul is to the body.</p>

<p>We can examine ourselves today to see whether like those first Christians, we too give a good example to the extent that we do in fact move others to come closer to Christ. Do we edify others by our sobriety? By the way we spend money? By our unquenchable cheerfulness? By doing our work well? By keeping our word? By the way we live justice at work with our subordinates and our peers? By carrying out works of mercy, and by never having a bad word to say about anybody at all?</p>

<p>The first Christians often came up against serious obstacles and misunderstandings, which in not a few cases led to their death for defending their faith in the Master. Today on this feast we celebrate the testimony of the first Roman martyrs. Their execution was the result of the burning of Rome in the year 64. This catastrophe provided the excuse for the first great persecution. To Saint Peter and Paul, whose feast we celebrated yesterday, were added a great number of chosen ones, “who having gone under many sufferings and torments out of envy, were the best models among us,” says Saint Clement of Rome. We read this in a vivid account to be found among the earliest Christian writings.</p>

<p>The obstacles and misunderstandings encountered by those who had been converted did not inevitably lead them to martyrdom. But they often experienced in their lives what the words of the Holy Spirit warn us in scripture. Indeed, says Saint Paul to Timothy, “All who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted” (2 Tim. 3:12). Sometimes the pagans’ antagonism to the followers of Christ arose because they could not bear the rich fruitfulness and splendor of devotion in the Christian daily life. At other times it arose because those who had received the faith had the duty of abstaining from the traditional religious ceremonial which was closely bound up with public life, and was even considered a test of loyalty, an open and formal proof of civic faithfulness to Rome and to the emperor.</p>

<p>Consequently, the pagans who embraced Christianity laid themselves open to misunderstandings and slanderous attacks for not conforming, for not being like the others. It’s unlikely that God will ask us to shed our blood in order to confess the Christian faith. Although if God were to allow such a trial we would ask him for the grace to enable us to give our lives in testimony of our love for him. We will however, in one way or another, meet all kinds of adversity. For being with Jesus means we shall most certainly come upon his cross.</p>

<p>“When we abandon ourselves into God’s hands, he frequently permits us to taste sorrow, loneliness, opposition, slander, defamation, ridicule, coming from both within and from outside the Church,” Saint Josemaría wrote in <em>Friends of God</em>. “This is because he wants to mold and form us into his own image and likeness. He even tolerates our being called lunatics and allows us, if we will, to be taken for fools. This is the way Jesus fashions the souls of those he loves. While at the same time never failing to give them inner calm and joy.”</p>

<p>Slander, perhaps seeing doors to promotion closed against us at work, friends or workmates who turn their backs on us, sarcastic remarks or derogatory words. If God allows them, we have to try and make use of such contradictions in order to live charity in a more heroic way. Precisely with those very people who do not have any respect for us. Perhaps out of inculpable ignorance. Our attitude can always include a just defense when necessary, especially when we have to avoid the possibility of scandal, or of injury being caused to third persons. Such situations will be a great help in enabling us to cleanse ourselves of our own sins and faults, to make reparation for those of others, to ask pardon for the offense that is made against God by them. And finally, to grow in virtue and in love of God.</p>

<p>God sometimes wants to purify us like gold in the crucible. Saint Jerome Emiliano said fire cleans gold from the dross, freeing it from impurities and greatly enhancing its value. God does the same with the good servant, who hopes and who remains constant in the midst of tribulation. If contradictions lie in our way and troubles beset us because we follow Jesus closely, we have then to be especially cheerful and give thanks to God. It makes us worthy to suffer something for him, as the apostles did. We’re told in the Acts of the Apostles, “Then they left the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the name” (Acts 5:41).</p>

<p>The apostles would doubtless have remembered the words of the Master, just as we meditate on them today during this feast of the first Roman martyrs. We are told in Saint Matthew, “Blessed are you when men revile you, and persecute you, and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for so men persecuted the prophets who went before you” (Matt. 5:11–12).</p>

<p>In spite of all ill-considered slander, infamy itself, and outbreaks of persecution, our first brothers in the faith did not fail to carry out an effective apostolate. They did not fail to tell people about Christ. The treasure they themselves had had the good fortune to find. Moreover, their calm and joyful bearing in the face of adversity, and even of death, was the very reason why many came to know the Master.</p>

<p>Tertullian says the deaths of the martyrs were the seeds of Christians. The Roman community itself, after so many men, women and children had given their lives in the course of that terrible persecution, went forward invigorated and strengthened. Years later, Tertullian wrote, “We are of but yesterday, and already we have filled the world and all your things. Cities, islands, towns, villages, hamlets, the army, the palace, the senate, the forum. We have left you only the temples.”</p>

<p>In our own sphere, in our present circumstances, if we perhaps encounter some slight difficulty to our remaining firm in the faith, we should understand that from this particular spot of bother will come a great good for all. It is at such times that we have most reason, and most need to speak with serenity about the wonder of the faith. About the immense gift of the sacraments. About the beauty of the fruits of living holy purity well. We should understand that we have elected to be on the winning side in the combat of this life, and also in that other glorious life that awaits us shortly.</p>

<p>Nothing compares with being close to Christ. Even if we had no possessions at all and had to suffer the painful illnesses of the most vile slander, so long as we possess Jesus, we possess everything. The effect of this realization should be noticeable even in our outward bearing, and in our awareness that we are at every moment, even in such circumstances, the salt of the earth and the light of the world, as the Master has told us. Referring to the philosophers of his day, Saint Justin rightly said that all the good spoken by them belongs to us Christians. Because after God, we adore and love the Word, who proceeds from the unbegotten and ineffable God himself. Indeed, for love of us he became man, so as to share in our sufferings and heal us.</p>

<p>In the opening prayer of the Mass today, we say, “Father you sanctified the church of Rome with the blood of its first martyrs. May we find strength in their courage and rejoice in their triumph.” This world of ours that we have to bring to you Jesus sometimes asks the apostles to listen attentively to his doctrine. At other times he calls them together so that he can be alone with them and explains a parable to them once again. Or shows them what lesson they should draw from something that has happened. He wants them to realize that they are being given a treasure, which is meant for the whole church, and of which later they will have to give an account.</p>

<p>“Take heed,” he says to them on one occasion. And he gives them the lesson. “To him who has will more be given, and from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away” (Mark 4:24–25). Saint John Chrysostom comments, to him who is diligent and fervent, will be given all the things that depend on God. But to him who has no love or fervor, and does not do what depends on him, what belongs to God will not be given him. For even what he thinks he has will be taken away. Not because God takes it away from him, but because he is incapable of receiving such graces.</p>

<p>“To him who has will more be given.” This is a basic teaching, says Saint Augustine, for the interior life of every Christian. To him who corresponds with grace, more grace will be given, so that he will have still more grace. But he who fails to make the inspirations, motions, and help of the Holy Spirit bear fruit will become even poorer. Those men who traded with their talents entrusted to them received a greater fortune or reward. But the man who hid his talent in the ground lost it.</p>

<p>Interior life, like love, is destined to grow. “If you say enough,” says Saint Augustine, “you are already dead.” Interior life always demands progress, correspondence, being ready to receive new graces. If you don’t go forward, you go backwards. God has promised that we will always have access to all the help we need at every moment. We’ll be able to say with the psalmist, “The Lord takes care for me” (Ps. 40:17). The difficulties, temptations, internal or external obstacles we come up against all cause us to grow. The greater the difficulty, the more the grace we receive.</p>

<p>If he permits us to experience great temptations or setbacks, he will give us proportionately still greater help to overcome them. Then all those things that seem to retard our struggle for holiness or even make succeeding in it seem impossible, will become the cause of spiritual progress and of our effectiveness in the apostolate. Saint Augustine says it’s only a lack of love, nothing less than lukewarmness, that causes the soul’s life to fall sick or die. Only a bad will, a lack of generosity towards God, can delay or prevent our union with him.</p>

<p>The vessel of faith carried to the fountain is filled according to its capacity. Christ is an inexhaustible source of help, of love, and of understanding. We can ask ourselves and examine ourselves with what capacity, with what longing do we approach him. Lord, we say to him in our prayer, make us thirst for you more and more, as the first Christians did. Make me thirst for you even more intensely than the man dying in the desert thirsts for water.</p>

<p>There are various reasons that can cause us to make scant progress in our interior life, and even to lose ground and give way to discouragement. But these reasons can be reduced to just a few. Carelessness, negligence in little things connected with service to God and friendship with him. Drawing back from the sacrifices that he asks of us. All we have to do, all we have to offer to God each day, are our little acts of faith and love. Petitions, acts of thanksgiving, thanksgiving after Mass, visit to the Blessed Sacrament and being aware that we’re going to meet Jesus Christ himself who is waiting for us. Our customary prayers throughout the day.</p>

<p>Human life is in some way a constant returning to the Father’s house. We return to our Father’s house by means of the sacrament of penance. In <em>Christ is Passing By</em>, we’re told God is waiting for us like the father in the parable, with open arms, even though we don’t deserve it. It doesn’t matter how great our debt is. Just like the prodigal son, all we have to do is open our heart, to be homesick for our Father’s house. To wonder at and rejoice in the gift which God makes us of being able to call ourselves his children, of really being his children, even though our response to him has been so poor.</p>

<p>God never abandons us. He always welcomes us, comforts us, and moves us to start again with more love, with more humility. Our weaknesses help us to seek for divine mercy and be humble. Growth in the virtue of humility means we’re able to make many steps forward in the interior life. All the virtues benefit from our being more humble. If at times we find we fail to correspond with all the graces we’ve received, if we have not been as faithful to God as he was expecting us to be, we must turn contritely to him with a contrite heart.</p>

<p>The Psalms say “Create a clean heart in me O God, and put a new and right spirit within me” (Ps. 51:10). We should often think of those things which, although they’re small, separate us from God. Then we will be moved to sorrow and contrition and be brought closer to him. In this way, our interior life emerges enriched, not only by our contending with exterior obstacles, but also by the recognition of our weakness, our mistakes, and our sins, drawing back from the sacrifices that he asks of us.</p>

<p>If we find it more difficult to begin again, our mother is always there to help us. She makes the way that leads to her son easier. We can ask her to help us with many acts of contrition. It’s interesting how the first Christians of Rome had great devotion to Our Lady, and in many streets of Rome you find a large image of Our Lady built into the building structure itself. We might find it helpful to repeat the prayer of the tax collector, “God be merciful to me a sinner” (Luke 18:13), or the prayer of King David, “A humble and contrite heart O Lord, you will not spurn” (Ps. 51:17).</p>

<p>Love grows within us and develops in the midst of our setbacks and the resistance each of us puts to that love on the inside. It also grows and develops in the face of resistance from the outside. That is, despite the many external forces that are foreign and even hostile to it. Our Lord has promised us that the help of his grace will never fail us. It all depends on our correspondence and our determination, and our willingness to start time and again without getting discouraged. The more faithful we are to grace, the more help he gives us, the easier we will find it to follow the way.</p>

<p>We’ll also find that more is being demanded of us and even greater finesse in our soul. Love always calls for more love. This interior life of ours is given a special chance to grow when we’re confronted with those adverse situations. For the soul, there is no obstacle greater than that which is created by our own wretchedness, and as a result of our carelessness and lack of love. But in those circumstances, says Saint Francis de Sales, the Holy Spirit teaches us and moves us to react in a supernatural way, with an act of contrition. God be merciful to me a sinner.</p>

<p>Saint Francis de Sales teaches us that we should feel ourselves strengthened by the silent saying of aspiratory prayers filled with love and sorrow, and desires for a deeper reconciliation, so that through them we may come to trust in his merciful heart. Acts of contrition are an effective means of spiritual progress. To ask for forgiveness is to love. It is to contemplate Christ the growing dispositions of understanding and mercy. As we are sinners, our way will be filled with acts of sorrow, of love that fill our soul with hope and renew our longing to set off again on the way to sanctity.</p>

<p>We need to return to Christ time and again without becoming discouraged or overworried. Although there may be many times when we have not responded well to love. God’s mercy is infinite and encourages us to start out again with a new determination, with renewed hope. We must be like the prodigal son. Instead of remaining far away in a foreign land, filled with shame and living in misery, he came to his senses and said “I will arise and go to my father” (Luke 15:18).</p>

<p>Let us ask Our Lord that our interior life would be nourished by the little things that we carry out with love and attention. Saint Josemaría wrote, to claim anything else would be to mistake our way. To find nothing or very little to offer to God. It’s good to remember how we find in <em>Christ is Passing By</em> the story of that character imagined by a French author, who set out to hunt lions in the corridors of his home. Naturally he didn’t find any. Our life is quite ordinary. Trying to serve God in big things would be like trying to hunt lions in the corridor. Just like the huntsman in the story, we would end up empty-handed.</p>

<p>Let us try to learn today from the example of the early Christians. We can ask Our Lady, our mother in the order of grace, mother of mercy and of forgiveness, to always enkindle in us the hope of attaining the ambitious target of becoming saints. May we place the fruits of these moments of personal prayer in your hands, with the conviction that if we correspond to grace, still more grace will be given to us.</p>

<p><em>I thank you my God for the good resolutions, affections, and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice. My immaculate mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel intercede for me.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p>(<em>Proofread</em>)</p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>Our Lord will always enlighten those who seek Him with a clean heart. To think about the life of St. Joseph is to discover a life full of joys and sorrows. Our Lord teaches us through the life of the Holy Patriarch that true happiness is never far from the Cross. If we bear suffering and trial with supernatural spirit, we will soon be rewarded with clarity and peace. With Christ at our side, sorrows turn into joys.</p>

<p>The Gospel relates the first sorrow and first joy of St. Joseph. We’re told, “When Mary his mother had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit” (Matt. 1:18).</p>

<p>Joseph was well aware of the holiness of his spouse, even though he could not understand the evident fact of her maternity. He was deeply perplexed. He loved Our Lady with a pure and deep human love. Yet he felt obliged by his upright conscience to follow the Mosaic Law in this regrettable situation.</p>

<p>In order to protect Mary from public shame, Joseph decided to put her away privately. This was a most painful test for both Joseph and Mary.</p>

<p>Just as his sorrow was great, so was Joseph’s joy immeasurable when at last he was shown the ways of God’s Providence. We’re told, “But while he thought on these things…” (Matt. 1:20).</p>

<p>These were the things that he could not hope to fathom, that he was unable to share with anyone. In the midst of this trial Joseph was visited by an angel, who said: “Do not be afraid, Joseph, son of David, to take to you Mary your wife, for that which is begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit” (<em>ibid</em>.).</p>

<p>All of Joseph’s doubts vanished at once. Everything had become clear. His soul had become filled with God’s peace. He now understood that he was the recipient of two incredible treasures, Jesus and Mary. He had been given for his wife the Mother of God. He had been given for a son the Son of God.</p>

<p>Joseph had become a different person. John Paul II says, “He became a unique guardian of the mystery ‘hidden for ages in God’ (Eph. 3:9)” (John Paul II, Apostolic Exhortation, <em>Redemptoris custos</em>, Point 5, August 15, 1989).</p>

<p>We can learn from Joseph’s first sorrow and joy that Our Lord will always enlighten those who seek Him with a clean heart. God’s light can shine through the most perplexing situations imaginable.</p>

<p>How often does it happen that we fail to grasp the meaning of God’s plans, the ‘why’ behind different circumstances and events. If we take care to trust in Our Lord, we will come to appreciate His divine wisdom. With that realization we will discover a deep sense of peace and joy in our soul.</p>

<p>A few months later, Joseph and Mary set off from Nazareth to Bethlehem to enroll in the census decreed by Caesar Augustus (<em>cf</em>. Luke 2:1). After this three or four-day journey, they were tired and worn out. This must have been especially true of Our Lady, a mother with child.</p>

<p>They had arrived at the town of their forefathers but they had no place to stay. There was no room for them at the inn. There was no home for them anywhere.</p>

<p>We can imagine Joseph going from door to door in search of shelter and hospitality for his pregnant wife. At each door he would have made the same simple request: ‘We have just arrived in town. My wife is about to deliver a child.’</p>

<p>Everywhere he must have received the same negative reply. Our Lady was probably close by on their donkey, a silent witness to this trying search.</p>

<p>What must this experience have been like for St. Joseph? What must have been his feelings at the sight of his weary wife, her clothing travel-stained, and every feature proclaiming her utter exhaustion?</p>

<p>Eventually they learned of some caves on the outskirts of the town. Joseph took Our Lady to one of those places which served as a stable. Our Lady could go no farther. “And it came to pass while they were there, that the days for her to be delivered were fulfilled. And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger” (Luke 2:6-7).</p>

<p>All of the anxiety and suffering that was there in that journey was quickly forgotten from the moment that Our Lady held the Son of God in her arms. St. Joseph would have realized that the Son of God was now his son as well. He would have kissed Him and worshipped Him.</p>

<p>In the midst of this simplicity and poverty, a multitude of the heavenly host appeared and proclaimed: “Glory to God in the highest” (Luke 2:14).</p>

<p>One writer says Our Lady experienced a great joy in these moments, and St. Joseph participated in her happiness. He contemplated the way she looked upon her Son, the way she spoke to Him, the way she watched over Him with loving reverence (<em>cf</em>. Federico Suarez, <em>Joseph of Nazareth</em>).</p>

<p>This alternating sorrow and joy should teach us that serving God is worth the effort, even though we will encounter difficulties, and perhaps poverty and pain. In the final analysis, a single look from Our Lady will more than make up for the little and not-so-little sufferings which may come our way.</p>

<p>We’re told in St. Luke, “When eight days were fulfilled for his circumcision, his name was called Jesus, the name given him by the angel before he was conceived in the womb” (Luke 2:21).</p>

<p>By means of this rite, each male was initiated into the community of the Chosen People. The ceremony took place either in the paternal home or in the local synagogue. The boy’s name was imposed at this time. The actual ceremony was sometimes performed by his father.</p>

<p>The giving of names had a special significance for the Jewish people. The name Jesus means <em>Savior</em>; it had been chosen by God Himself and communicated through the message of the angel: “You shall call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins” (Matt. 1:21).</p>

<p>It was the desire of the Holy Trinity that the Son should commence His salvific mission on earth in suffering. It would seem fitting that Joseph was the one to inaugurate the mystery of the Redemption by shedding the first drops of his Son’s holy blood.</p>

<p>One writer said this blood would yield its full effect in the awful context of the Passion (<em>cf</em>. Michel Gasnier, <em>Joseph the Silent</em>). The child who cried upon the receipt of His name had thereupon begun His work of salvation.</p>

<p>St. Joseph was himself pained at the sight of these first drops of blood. He was well versed in the Scriptures, and he knew, if only in an imperfect way, that there would come a day when his Son would have to shed His blood even to the last drop.</p>

<p>Joseph was filled with joy to carry the child in his arms and call Him Jesus, a name which countless people would later repeat with awe, with profound respect, and devotion. Joseph was always aware of the mystery involved in that name.</p>

<p>We’re told in St. Luke, “And when the days of her purification were fulfilled according to the Law of Moses, they took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord” (Luke 2:22). The Temple was to be the setting for the purification of Our Lady and the presentation of Our Lord, as prescribed by the Mosaic Law.</p>

<p>Upon their arrival at the Temple, the Holy Family were met by an elderly man called Simeon who was inspired by the Holy Spirit. Simeon took the child into his arms and with immense joy he praised God.</p>

<p>Simeon prophesied that this young child would become a “sign of contradiction” which many would obstinately reject. He foretold that Mary would be intimately united with the redemptive work of her Son. “A sword” would pass through her heart (<em>cf</em>. Luke 2:25-35).</p>

<p>This sword signifies a deep and lasting wound. Mary then understood the immensity of her Son’s sacrifice as well as the immensity of her own. The sorrow in this sacrifice was to be all the greater because some would reject as unwanted the graces won for them by her Son.</p>

<p>The prophecy of Simeon, one writer said, “the sword in the heart of Mary is also the sword in the heart of Joseph, since they were of one heart, <em>cor unum et anima una</em>, one heart and one soul. This sword represents the battle for or against Jesus. Mary is, therefore, directly tied…to the many diverse acts which constitute the history of mankind. It should be evident to us, however, that Joseph is also heavily involved in this struggle inasmuch as he was a loyal and loving husband” (Leon Cristiani, <em>St. Joseph, Patron of the Universal Church</em>).</p>

<p>When Joseph heard the prophecy of Simeon, surely a sword must have pierced his heart as well.</p>

<p>On that day in the Temple Joseph and Mary were given a more profound insight into the mystery of the Redemption which their Son would bring to completion. St. Joseph was now able to understand a little better the sorrow of his wife and Son. He made this suffering his own. He would probably never have forgotten the words that he heard in the Temple that morning.</p>

<p>Alongside the pain there must also have been the joy of impending universal redemption. Jesus was the salvation “prepared before the face of all peoples: a light of revelation to the Gentiles, and a glory for your people Israel” (Luke 2:31-32). No pain is greater than beholding a stubborn resistance to grace. No joy is comparable to understanding that the Redemption is being carried out in our time and that many souls are coming close to Christ.</p>

<p>We’ve all experienced the joy when a friend has returned to the sacrament of Penance, or when a friend has given his or her life to God without conditions.</p>

<p>One writer says: “O most holy and lovable Virgin! Help us to share in the sufferings of Jesus as you yourself did. Help us to have a profound horror of sin, an even greater desire for holiness, and a generous love for Jesus and his Cross. We would like to make reparation through our acts of love for your great sufferings and humiliations” (Adolphe Tanqueray, <em>The Divinization of Suffering</em>).</p>

<p>We can ask St. Joseph, our father and lord, to help us by his powerful intercession to bring Jesus to many people who live out their lives apart from Him.</p>

<p>St. Joseph was the custodian of Jesus and Mary, a father and spouse—foster father of Jesus and husband of Our Lady, the Mother of God. He was the person who was closest to Our Lord on earth after His Mother, the legal and practical father of Jesus.</p>

<p>The angel tells him to name the child Jesus; this was a right found only for fathers. He was the person who worked, suffered, and most cared for Jesus after Our Lady.</p>

<p>Our Lord must have been eternally grateful for all the things that he did for Him. He must have given him a great heaven. That’s why many fathers of the Church think that after Mary, he is the greatest. Together with Our Lord and Our Lady, he forms with them the Trinity on earth.</p>

<p>He must have taught Jesus, the Son of God, to work, to read, to write. He must have taught Him ways of speaking that must come out in the parables.</p>

<p>He was called in a special way to fulfill these two tasks: custodian of Jesus and Mary. In that vocation, all his other graces find their reason for being.</p>

<p>St. Jerome assigns some reasons for Mary’s espousal to Joseph: so that the ancestry of Mary be demonstrated by the genealogy of Joseph; so that she would not be stoned by the Jews as an adulteress; so that in her running away to Egypt she may have support; and the martyr Ignatius adds even a further reason: so that the birth of Christ may be hidden from the devil (<em>cf</em>. Jerome, <em>Against Helvidius</em>).</p>

<p>Joseph deemed himself unworthy of the Virgin Mother’s company. He trembled on beholding that she bore in her womb the Divinity Incarnate. He couldn’t fathom the mystery (Mary of Agreda, <em>The Mystical City of God</em>).</p>

<p>The angel tells us of the emotion of Joseph, which was fear (Matt. 1:20). In Scripture, the just men, when faced with divine mysteries, always express fear. If he suspected Mary of unfaithfulness, probably the emotion would not have been fear.</p>

<p>St. Josemaría loved St. Joseph so much that in his last years he used to say that his love grew in an impetuous manner (<em>cf</em>. Andrés Vázquez de Prada, <em>The Founder of Opus Dei</em>, Volume III). Each day that went by, he said that he loved him with a new impetus that was capable of overcoming all difficulties.</p>

<p>Why? Because God had reserved for St. Joseph the highest place that was possible to occupy after that of Our Lord and Our Lady.</p>

<p>God asked St. Joseph for something very big. Our Lady was the Mother of God, and he had the mission of covering up the miraculous maternity of his wife.</p>

<p>Jesus had to be a man like any other, so it was necessary for Joseph to be there. It was necessary for Joseph to participate in the game, you might say, in this divine game, and that he should be “a just man,” as Scripture says (Matt. 1:19)—a man who loved the will of God, and who always tried to put it into practice. The name of Joseph means “increase” (<em>cf</em>. Gen. 30:24).</p>

<p>For St. Joseph, the life of Jesus was a continuous discovery of his own vocation. As a light, the vocation is a maturing in the faith. It means growing in the life of grace. It doesn’t exclude all traces of obscurity, which are proper to the life of faith on earth. It fills one’s entire life.</p>

<p>For many people who approach God, it’s a light that sheds meaning on their lives. It’s a possibility that they discover in the depths of their being a light that gives meaning to their life so far and opens horizons for the future. By the light of faith, the person discovers God’s call to follow Him.</p>

<p>As an impulse, the vocation is a blossoming of charity, and therefore of freedom. God’s call and a person’s response mean the beginning of a transforming friendship (Hans Urs von Balthasar, <em>Vocation</em>).</p>

<p>St. Josemaría says, “St. Joseph, more than anyone else before or since, learned from Jesus to be alert to recognize the wonders of God, to have his mind and heart awake” (Josemaría Escrivá, <em>Christ Is Passing By</em>, Point 54).</p>

<p>We imitate St. Joseph by sanctifying our professional work. If our work is the work of a carpenter, then that’s the one we’re going to sanctify. If it’s that of an intellectual, man or woman, then that’s the one we’re going to sanctify. Which is more important, St. Josemaría would ask. The answer would be, “the one which is done with more love of God.” It is the love of God that gives divine importance to human things (<em>cf</em>. J. Escrivá, <em>Friends of God</em>, Point 55).</p>

<p>In that, St. Joseph gave us a great lesson. The call from God is a grace of Our Lord. A gift. A choice made by divine goodness.</p>

<p>Many young people change their lives when they decide to follow Our Lord. We can see them progress in their interior lives in a way that might previously have seemed unimaginable.</p>

<p>With faith come morals. By the light of faith, we can recognize in this change of life a sign of God’s call as He touches the soul and prepares it to fulfill the mission on which it is set out.</p>

<p>This is a lasting impulse, an interior grace which lasts a lifetime. St. Josemaría liked to say that perseverance in a vocation is the clearest sign of its divinity (<em>cf</em>. J. Escrivá, <em>The Way</em>, Point 983).</p>

<p>Vocation is a deep personal adherence that affects the whole person throughout their life. It grows with the person. Insofar as it is a free and irrevocable choice, it constantly helps one mature and produce the fruits of perseverance.</p>

<p>As a light and an impulse, the vocation exists at the level of theological faith. This means that even though it’s a special gift from God, and it’s important that it’s always perceived and presented in this way, recognizing it does not require extraordinary manifestations except in extraordinary circumstances.</p>

<p>St. Josemaría has said we cannot doubt that we have been deliberately chosen to be co-redeemers. Along with all the other reasons we have often considered, we have an external sign: the fact that we have been laboring so willingly in his work for no earthly gain.</p>

<p>In St. John, we’re told “The wind blows where it wills, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know whence it comes or whither it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit” (John 3:8).</p>

<p>Msgr. Fernando Ocáriz, Prelate of Opus Dei, has said, “While faith tells an individual that there is a general vocation to sanctity—communion with God in Jesus Christ—the existence of a special vocation for oneself is not the direct object of theological faith; it comes from natural knowledge of signs which, when seen in the light of grace of that special vocation, lead the mind to a moral certainty that one is being called.</p>

<p>“The fact that God (normally) does not impose a special vocation as an evident truth allows us to think that he wants the person’s freedom to come into play not only in the moment of answering the call, but in its shaping as well” (Pedro Rodriguez, Fernando Ocáriz, and Jose Luis Illanes, <em>Opus Dei in the Church</em>).</p>

<p>There are also some attitudes that are good to nurture in souls to equip them to recognize a call from God and give themselves: generosity, cheerful self-giving, and especially loving as Christ taught; awareness of the grandeur of being part of something greater than ourselves, that is, the beauty that surrounds the mystery of the Church and our participation in it.</p>

<p>In a climate of individualistic hedonism, these attitudes cannot always be taken for granted. In many cases, it’s an encounter with the mission for which one seems particularly suited, and with which one can identify with one’s own talents and aspirations, which sets the spark of vocational light in the soul. Each of the enormous varieties of different vocations found in the Church draws its specificity not from the level of holiness acquired—because one and all are called to holiness—but rather from the particular ecclesial mission that each one is invited to carry out.</p>

<p>This responsibility can then take focus in a thousand different ways. God’s call is doubtlessly the fullest response, as beautiful as it is demanding, to the aspirations born in a young heart.</p>

<p>In <em>The Forge</em>, St. Josemaría says “Committed! How I love that word!” (J. Escrivá, <em>The Forge</em>, Point 855). St. Joseph led a life of commitment. He obviously had a great love for his vocation. Each one of us should have a great love for our vocation. It is the best.</p>

<p>We can ask him to help us to foster a sincere desire for holiness, to desire that goal of our vocation. Sanctity is continuously doing what God wants, not what we want. We have to try and work at our vocation every day, to polish up that vocation, to keep the message of our vocation very clear on a day-to-day basis.</p>

<p>With all these things, we see a great example in St. Joseph. “How I love that word!” St. Josemaría says, “We children of God freely put ourselves under an obligation to live a life of dedication to God, striving that he may have complete and absolute sovereignty over our lives” (<em>ibid</em>.).</p>

<p>We can ask St. Joseph to help us to live out our vocation in the ways that God wants us each day of our life. From our meditation on his vocation, may we come to give ourselves in a greater way on a day-to-day basis.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

Conor Donnelly</p>

<p><em>(Proofread)</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins, and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful.</em></p>

<p><em>My Immaculate Mother, St. Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>St. John the Baptist is the only saint who is honored by the church on both the occasion of his birth and of his death.</p>

<p>Christ’s precursor teaches every one of us by his example of heroic fortitude to fulfill God’s will in our lives, no matter what the obstacles may be.</p>

<p>In the entrance antiphon of today’s mass, it says, “Lord, I shall expound your law before kings and not fear disgrace. I shall ponder your decrees which I have always loved” (Ps. 119:46–47).</p>

<p>The church celebrates the birth of John the Baptist on June 24th. Today she commemorates his <em>dies natalis</em>, the day of his final birth, the day of his death.</p>

<p>King Herod, as St. Mark calls him, ordered his execution.</p>

<p>Herod is one of the most pitiful individuals in the gospel. He ruled during Christ’s years of preaching and his manifestation as the awaited Messiah. He had even met the savior’s precursor.</p>

<p>“Behold the Lamb of God,” the Baptist told some of his disciples (John 1:36). Herod also used to enjoy hearing him speak.</p>

<p>He could have met Christ, whom he longed to see in person, but he committed the enormous injustice of beheading the one entrusted with the mission of pointing him out.</p>

<p>Immoral habits and evil passions led him to the awful crime. They also prevented him from perceiving the truth.</p>

<p>When he finally did meet Christ face to face, he blasphemously proposed the Lord of heaven and earth entertain him and his friends with a miracle.</p>

<p>St. John the Baptist preached what specific individuals needed to hear, given their particular circumstances in society. He spoke to common townspeople, publicans, soldiers, Pharisees, and Sadducees, and even to Herod himself.</p>

<p>Through his humble and austere example of integrity, he affirmed his testimony concerning the arrival of the Messiah.</p>

<p>The Baptist told Herod, “It’s not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife” (Mark 6:18).</p>

<p>He had no fear of the great and powerful, nor did he give importance to their threats. He bore in his heart God’s counsel to the prophet Jeremiah, which is recalled in the first reading of today’s Mass.</p>

<p>“Brace yourself for action, stand up and tell them all I command you. Do not be dismayed at their presence or in their presence I will make you dismayed.</p>

<p>“I, for my part, will make you into a fortified city, a pillar of iron, and a wall of bronze to confront the whole land.</p>

<p>The kings of Judah, its princes, its priests, and the country people will fight against you, but shall not overcome you, for I am with you to deliver you” (Jer. 1:17–19).</p>

<p>Our Lord asks for our fortitude in everyday things. He wants our exemplary life and our words to be a simple witness of our love for Christ and for his church, without ever giving in to fear or human respect.</p>

<p>St. Mark narrates how Herod had taken John and bound him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, whom he had married. She hated the Baptist because he had reproached the tetrarch for the notorious scandal of their illegitimate union.</p>

<p>She therefore sought to kill him.</p>

<p>But Herod liked to hear him speak, knowing that John was a just and holy man, and he feared and protected him.</p>

<p>Her opportunity arose when the king gave a banquet on his birthday and invited the foremost men of the region.</p>

<p>The daughter of Herodias danced in the sight of all and pleased Herod and his guests. The king swore to her, “Ask me for whatever you wish and I will give it to you, even though it be half my kingdom” (Mark 6:22–23).</p>

<p>Prompted by her mother, the girl demanded the head of John the Baptist.</p>

<p>Grieved as he was, the king was unwilling to displease her because of his oath and of his guests.</p>

<p>The disciples of the Baptist later took away his body and laid it in a tomb. Many of them would now become faithful followers of Christ.</p>

<p>John the Baptist was completely dedicated to Our Lord. He put all his energy into preparing Christ’s disciples for the master’s arrival, and in the end, he surrendered his very life.</p>

<p>St. Bede comments, there’s no doubt St. John suffered prison and chains as a forerunner of our Redeemer.</p>

<p>Though Herod did not demand that he deny Christ, he did try to oblige the Baptist to remain silent about the truth. We can therefore affirm that the precursor did suffer martyrdom.</p>

<p>Since death was ever near at hand through the inescapable necessity of nature, the martyr considered it a blessing to embrace it for acknowledging Christ’s name in return for the reward of eternal life.</p>

<p>St. Paul says of them, “You have been granted the privilege not only to believe in Christ but also to suffer for his sake” (Phil. 1:29).</p>

<p>St. Bede says he tells us why it is Christ’s gift that his chosen ones should suffer for him. “The sufferings of the present life are not worthy to be compared to the glory that is to be revealed in us” (Rom. 8:18).</p>

<p>Throughout the centuries, followers of Christ have rejoiced in suffering persecutions, tribulations, and unexpected difficulties for the faith.</p>

<p>Many have imitated the example of the apostles. After being lashed, they were enjoined not to speak in the name of Jesus and then released.</p>

<p>“They departed from the Sanhedrin, rejoicing over being deemed worthy to endure trial for the name of Christ.</p>

<p>Far from being intimidated, not for a single day did they cease teaching and preaching the good news of Jesus as the Christ” (Acts 5:41–42).</p>

<p>They must have recalled Our Lord’s counsel as recorded by St. Matthew. “Blessed are you when men reproach you and persecute you and speak falsely and say all manner of evil against you for my sake.</p>

<p>Rejoice and be glad, because your reward is great in heaven. For so did the men persecute the prophets who were before you” (Matt. 5:11–12).</p>

<p>We can make a resolution not to be disheartened or to complain if at some point in our life we have to suffer for being faithful to the call that we have received from Our Lord.</p>

<p>The history of the Church shows that all those who follow closely in the footsteps of Christ experience difficult moments and encounter the cross.</p>

<p>To ascend Calvary and co-redeem with Jesus, there are no easy and comfortable routes.</p>

<p>Even in the early Church, St. Peter writes a letter to all Christians imbued with consolation in the midst of suffering.</p>

<p>It wasn’t a matter of the bloody persecutions that would come later, but of the distressing circumstances many would experience for living in accordance with their faith.</p>

<p>For some, adversity would come through the family. Slaves had to put up with injustices from their masters, and women with the intolerance of their husbands. For others, calumnies, discrimination, or similar affronts arose.</p>

<p>St. Peter reminds the faithful that the difficulties they encounter are not meaningless. They should contribute towards one’s personal purification.</p>

<p>God’s judgment, not man’s, is what counts.</p>

<p>In imitation of Christ, we should keep in mind that during adversity, we can draw down many graces for our persecutors, including faith, as has so often occurred in the past.</p>

<p>He calls these individuals blessed and encourages them to bear their sufferings with joy.</p>

<p>He also invites them to consider that through baptism, the Christian is incorporated into Christ and participates in the Easter mystery.</p>

<p>In the midst of suffering, each one of us can share in the passion, death, and resurrection of Jesus, who gives fruition to our daily cross.</p>

<p>Since the time of St. John the Baptist, countless souls have given their lives in fidelity to Christ.</p>

<p>Jesus awakened enthusiasm among his followers. Immediate contact with him infused confidence. These benefits established a certain tone of living faith among the first Christians, which lent their lives solidity and strength.</p>

<p>These attributes are still preserved in the community of the faithful. Christianity has yielded rich and magnificent fruits since its inception.</p>

<p>Christ enjoys the testimony of a nearly 2,000-year history.</p>

<p>In spite of all external opposition and even hidden resistance, the faith has penetrated the inner recesses of hearts and has had an enormous impact on the world.</p>

<p>The Church today is a haven for every noble and sacred value.</p>

<p>One writer says it has passed the test of time that Gamaliel spoke of with astounding success. If it were a mere fabrication of men, it would have fallen into ruin long ago.</p>

<p>We can see the strength of faith and the love of Christ at work in ourselves and in millions who profess him, despite what at times seems overwhelming opposition.</p>

<p>Most likely, Our Lord will not ask for our bloody martyrdom as a witness to the faith. If he should, though, we would gladly correspond with that grace.</p>

<p>Our normal duties, rather, will be our constant cheerfulness in confronting a pagan environment, since calumny, sarcasm, or scorn may come our way.</p>

<p>Our joy will then abound on earth and will be doubled in heaven.</p>

<p>The Church wants to make us realize that the cross is always very close to Jesus and his followers.</p>

<p>As he struggles for perfect righteousness, sanctity in the world, the Christian will meet difficult situations and attacks by the enemies of God.</p>

<p>Our Lord has warned us, “If the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you. Remember the word that I said to you, a servant is not greater than his master. If they persecuted me, they will persecute you” (John 15:18, 20).</p>

<p>Since the very beginning of the Church, this prophecy has been fulfilled. In our days too, if we really follow Our Lord, we’re going to suffer difficulties and persecutions, in one way or another, and of different kinds.</p>

<p>St. Augustine says every age is an age of martyrdom. He said, don’t say that Christians are not suffering persecution. St. Paul says “All who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted” (2 Tim. 3:12). He says all, with no one being excluded or exempted.</p>

<p>St. Augustine says, if you want to test the truth of this saying, you’ve only to begin to lead a pious life and you’ll see what good reason he had for saying this.</p>

<p>At the very beginning of the Church, the first Christians in Jerusalem were persecuted by the Jewish authorities. The apostles were flogged for preaching Christ Jesus, and suffered it joyfully.</p>

<p>“They left the presence of the council rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the name of Jesus” (Acts 5:41), we’re told in the Acts.</p>

<p>The apostles must have remembered the words of Our Lord when he said, “Blessed are you when men revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account.</p>

<p>Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven. For so men persecuted the prophets who were before you” (Matt. 5:11–12).</p>

<p>St. John Chrysostom says, don’t say that they didn’t suffer, but that they rejoiced to suffer.</p>

<p>We can see that by the use to which they instantly put their freedom. Immediately after the flogging they gave themselves up to preaching with wonderful zeal.</p>

<p>When Paul came to Rome, Christians were already known by the unmistakable sign of the cross and of contradiction. With regard to this sect, say the Jews of Rome to Paul, “We know that everywhere it is spoken against” (Acts 28:22).</p>

<p>Our Lord, when he calls us or asks us for something, knows all about our limitations and the difficulties which we shall meet along the way.</p>

<p>When the time of difficulty arrives, Jesus will be at our side helping us with his grace. “In the world, you have tribulation, but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world” (John 16:33).</p>

<p>We shouldn’t be disconcerted if sometimes on our journey towards sanctity, we have to suffer some tribulation, trivial or serious, in a world with so many heathen characteristics.</p>

<p>We can then ask Our Lord for the grace to imitate St. John the Baptist in his courage, in his joy, in his zeal for proclaiming the truth of Christ, even in difficult circumstances.</p>

<p>Persecution can take many forms. During the first centuries, it tried to destroy the Christian faith by physical violence.</p>

<p>At other times, Christians have also been and are deprived of their most elementary rights.</p>

<p>Or attempts are made to confuse simple people by campaigns aimed at undermining their faith.</p>

<p>Even in countries with a great Christian tradition, every sort of obstacle and difficulty is put in the way of parents who wish to educate their children in a truly Christian way.</p>

<p>Or Christians, simply because they’re Christians, are denied a fair chance of advancing in their profession.</p>

<p>In societies which describe themselves as free, it’s not unusual for a Christian to have to live in an obviously hostile atmosphere.</p>

<p>Then there’s hidden persecution, by a sarcastic ridiculing of Christian values, or by pressure of opinion which tries to frighten the weaker brethren into conformity.</p>

<p>It adds up to a bloodless but severe persecution which often makes use of calumny and slander.</p>

<p>In former times, says St. Augustine, Christians were incited to renounce Christ, now they’re taught to deny Christ. Then they were forced, now they’re taught. Then violence was used, now it is deception. Then one heard the shouts of the enemy, now when he prowls around, gentle and insinuating, it’s difficult to recognize him.</p>

<p>Everyone knows how he tried to force Christians to deny Christ. He tried to attract them to himself so that they would renounce him. But they confessed Christ and were crowned by him.</p>

<p>St. Augustine says, now they are taught to deny Christ by trickery because he doesn’t want them to realize that he is drawing them away from Christ.</p>

<p>St. Augustine seems to be talking about our own times. Our Lord also wished to warn his followers not to be disconcerted when they were misjudged, not by the heathen, but by their own brothers in the faith, who usually because of envy, stereotyped reactions, or lack of rectitude of intention, would think that they were offering a service to God by this unjust behavior.</p>

<p>All contradictions, but especially these last, must be endured in the company of Our Lord in the tabernacle.</p>

<p>There, the apostolate in which we’re working will acquire a special fruitfulness.</p>

<p>Circumstances like these mean that Our Lord is calling us in a special way to be united with him through prayer.</p>

<p>There are times when we have to dispel misunderstandings, but always with courage and patience, without ever returning evil for evil.</p>

<p>What’s more, our interior life has need of contradictions and obstacles in order to grow strong and consistent.</p>

<p>With the help of Our Lord, the soul comes out of these trials purified and more humble. We can take the joy of Our Lord in a special way and can say with St. Paul, “I am filled with comfort, with all our affliction, I am overjoyed” (2 Cor. 7:4).</p>

<p>In the opening prayer of today’s mass it says, Lord, grant us the grace to imitate your martyr, who prayed for his executioners, so that we may learn to love our enemies.</p>

<p>A Christian who’s persecuted for following Jesus will draw from this experience a great capacity for understanding other people and a firm resolution never to wound them, never to offend them, never to treat them badly.</p>

<p>Our Lord asks us also to pray for those who persecute us, “speaking the truth in love” (Eph. 4:15).</p>

<p>These words of St. Paul show us how to teach the doctrine of the gospel without losing the charity of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>The last beatitude finishes with a fervent promise from Our Lord. “Blessed are you when men revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven” (Matt. 5:11–12).</p>

<p>Our Lord is always a generous paymaster. We too have been called to spread Christ’s truth without fear or concealment, being inspired by John the Baptist who died for proclaiming the truth.</p>

<p>We’re told in St. Matthew, “Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul” (Matt. 10:28). The immortality of the soul is one of the most powerful truths of our faith.</p>

<p>Because of this, when it’s a question of proclaiming Christ’s saving doctrine, we can’t give in when we come up against obstacles. We must follow the saying of St. Josemaría in <em>The Way</em>, who says, “Don’t be afraid of the truth, even though the truth might mean your death.”</p>

<p>The day on which Christians are persecuted, slandered, or ill-treated for being disciples of Jesus Christ, is for them a day of victory and profit. “Your reward is great in heaven” (Matt. 5:12).</p>

<p>Even in this life, Our Lord pays with interest. But it’s in the next we can hope, if we are faithful, for an enormous reward. Here, joy can never be perfect. But when we come close to Our Lord through prayer and the sacraments, we enjoy a foretaste of eternal happiness.</p>

<p>St. Paul wrote to the Romans, “I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us” (Rom. 8:18).</p>

<p>The history of the Church shows that at times tribulation makes someone grow cowardly and cold in his relationship with God. At other times in the country, it ripens sanctity and souls who take up the cross of every day and follow Christ, becoming identified with him.</p>

<p>We always see this double possibility. The same difficulty, illness, misunderstandings, has different effects according to the dispositions of the soul.</p>

<p>If we want to be saints, it’s obvious that our disposition has to be that of always following Our Lord closely, in spite of the difficulties. At times of setback, it’s helpful to foster the hope of heaven. It will help us to be firm in our faith, when we’re faced with any kind of persecution or attempts to confuse us.</p>

<p>St. Teresa of Avila says, “If you always pursue this determination to die rather than to fail to reach the end of the road, the Lord may bring you through this life with a certain degree of thirst, but in the life which never ends, he will give you great abundance to drink, and you will have no fear of its failing you.”</p>

<p>Our joy will then abound on earth and be doubled in heaven. St. Josemaría says we need always to see problems in a positive light. Let obstacles only make them bigger. The grace of Our Lord will not be lacking.</p>

<p>We’re told in the psalms, “Through the very midst of the mountains the waters will pass” (cf. Ps. 104:10). You will pass through the mountains.</p>

<p>But we need faith, a keen and living faith, a faith like Peter’s. When you have it, Our Lord has said so, we will move mountains, humanly insuperable obstacles that rise up against our apostolic undertakings.</p>

<p>Moreover, God’s consolation will never be lacking. If at some point following the path of Jesus is more trying, as it was for St. John the Baptist, we can seek refuge in Our Lady, the help of Christians. She will provide us with protection and shelter us with her cloak.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, St. Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

Conor Donnelly</p>

<p><em>(Proofread)</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here. That you see me, and that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins, and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>Devotion to the Sacred Heart already existed in the Middle Ages as a private devotion. It appears as a liturgical feast in 1675, following the apparitions of Our Lord to Saint Margaret Mary Alacoque. In these revelations, the saint was given to know with special depth the need to make reparation for her personal sins and for the sins of the whole world, and to respond to Christ’s love.</p>

<p>Our Lord asked her to extend the practice of frequent Communion, especially on the first Friday of every month, in a spirit of reparation. He asked for the first Friday after the octave of Corpus Christi to be dedicated as a special feast to glorify His heart.</p>

<p>The feast was celebrated for the first time on the 21st of June, 1686. Pius IX extended it to the whole Church. In 1928, Pius XI gave it the splendor that it has today.</p>

<p>Beneath the symbol of the human heart of Jesus, we consider above all the infinite love of Christ for each individual soul. This is why devotion to the Sacred Heart stems from the principles of Christian doctrine, as Pope John Paul II has made clear in his abundant teaching about this consoling mystery.</p>

<p>In the entrance antiphon, we’re told that the designs of His heart shall endure from age to age, to rescue our souls from death and nourish us in our hunger.</p>

<p>There’s a twofold aspect to the solemnity that we celebrate today. On the one hand, there is thanksgiving for the wonder of God’s love for us. On the other, there is reparation. Because this love is often poorly responded to, or scarcely repaid. Even by those who have so many reasons for loving and thanking God.</p>

<p>The basis of Christian piety has always been the consideration of Christ’s love for all men. This is why devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus stems from the principles of Christian doctrine, says Pope Pius XII.</p>

<p>This devotion received a special impulse from the devotion and piety of many saints to whom Our Lord disclosed the secrets of His most loving heart, moving them to spread devotion to the Sacred Heart and to foster a spirit of reparation.</p>

<p>On the Friday after the octave of the feast of Corpus Christi, Our Lord asked Saint Margaret Mary to promote love for frequent Communion, especially on the first Friday of every month, in a spirit of reparation. He promised that He would let her share each Thursday to Friday night in His suffering in the Garden of Olives.</p>

<p>One year later, Our Lord appeared to her, laying bare His most Sacred Heart. He spoke to her in words that have nourished the piety of many souls. He said, “See this Heart that has loved men so much and has spared itself nothing, until it has exhausted itself and consumed itself in order to show them its love. I receive in return scarcely anything but ingratitude because of their irreverence and sacrileges, and because of the coldness and disdain they show towards Me in this Sacrament of Love.”</p>

<p>“But what hurts me still more is that it is hearts who are consecrated to Me who treat Me in this way. This is why I ask you that on the first Friday after the octave of Corpus Christi, a special feast may be dedicated to the honor of My heart, by receiving Communion on that day and making reparation with some act of atonement.”</p>

<p>Pope Saint John Paul II has said that in many parts of the Church, there exists the private custom of making reparation on the first Friday of the month with some Eucharistic act or by saying the Litany of the Sacred Heart. Moreover, the month of June is dedicated in a special way to the veneration of the Divine Heart. Not just on one day, the liturgical feast which generally falls in June, but every day.</p>

<p>The heart of Jesus is the source and expression of His infinite love for each person, whatever the person’s situation may be. Our Lord seeks out each one of us.</p>

<p>A beautiful text taken from the prophet Ezekiel says, “I am going to look after my flock myself, and keep all of it in view. As a shepherd keeps all his flock in sight when he stands up in the middle of his scattered sheep, so shall I keep my sheep in view. I shall rescue them from wherever they may have been scattered during the mist and darkness” (Ezek. 34:11–12).</p>

<p>Each person is an individual whom the Father has entrusted to the Son, so that he or she shall not perish, even though they may have strayed far away.</p>

<p>Jesus, true God and true man, loves the world with a human heart, says the Second Vatican Council. A heart that serves as a channel for God’s infinite love. Nobody has ever loved more than Jesus does. Nobody ever will love us more.</p>

<p>Saint Paul said to the Galatians, “He loved me and gave himself up for me” (Gal. 2:20). Each one of us can repeat those words. His heart is full of the Father’s love, full in a way that is at once both divine and human.</p>

<p>Christ’s heart loved as no other heart has ever loved. He experienced sadness and joy, compassion and sorrow. The Evangelists frequently tell us of the feelings of Jesus. As in Saint Mark where he says, “I have compassion on the crowd” (Mark 8:2). He had compassion on them because they were like sheep without a shepherd.</p>

<p>The successful outcome of His apostles’ first venture into evangelization made Him feel as we do when we receive some good news. Saint Luke says, “He rejoiced” (Luke 10:21). In Saint John, He weeps when death takes His friend from Him. Neither does Our Lord hide His disappointment—“Jerusalem, Jerusalem, killing the prophets. How often I would have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood, but you did not want to” (Matt. 23:37). How often.</p>

<p>Jesus sees the whole history of the Old Testament and of mankind, a portion of the Jewish people and of the Gentiles of all times, who will reject God’s love and mercy. We can say that in this passage, God is somehow weeping with human eyes for the sorrow He feels in His human heart. This is the real meaning of devotion to the Sacred Heart, to translate God’s nature into human terms for ourselves. It’s not a matter of indifference to Jesus, any less than is our daily relationship with Him at the present time. That some lepers fail to return to thank Him, after they had been cured.</p>

<p>He’s not indifferent to the hospitality and consideration shown towards a guest, as He told Simon the Pharisee. On many occasions, He experienced the great joy of seeing someone repent of his sins and become His disciple. Or also of seeing the generosity of those who left everything to follow Him.</p>

<p>He was affected by the joy of blind men who are able to see perhaps for the first time in their lives. Before celebrating the Last Supper, He was already thinking that He would remain with us forever by means of the Blessed Eucharist that He was about to institute. “I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer” (Luke 22:15).</p>

<p>This emotion must have been even stronger when He took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to His disciples, saying, “This is My body” (Luke 22:19). Who shall ever be able to express the feelings in His most loving heart, as He gave His mother to us on Calvary to be our mother?</p>

<p>When He had already surrendered His life to His Father, one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and at once there came out blood and water (cf. John 19:34). This open wound reminds us today of the immense love that Jesus has for us. Because He willingly gave the very last drop of His precious blood for us. As though each of us were alone in the world.</p>

<p>Are we not then going to approach Christ with confidence? What amount of wretchedness can prevent our loving Him, so long as our heart is big enough to ask for forgiveness?</p>

<p>After He had ascended into Heaven in His glorified body, Christ did not cease to love us. He doesn’t stop calling us now, to live always close to His most loving heart. Even in the glory of Heaven, in His hands and feet and side, He bears glowing marks of the wounds which represent the triple victory gained by Him over the devil, sin, and death.</p>

<p>Pius XII says He likewise has in His heart, placed as it were in a most precious shrine, those treasures of merit, the fruits of His triple triumph. These He bestows generously on redeemed mankind.</p>

<p>Today, on this solemnity, we adore the most Sacred Heart of Jesus. Since that heart of His participates in and is the natural and most expressive symbol of the inexhaustible love with which our divine Redeemer still loves mankind. That heart indeed, although it is no longer liable to the disturbances of this mortal life, still lives and beats. It is now inseparably joined with the Person of the Divine Word, and in it and through it with His divine will.</p>

<p>Wherefore, says Pope Pius XII, since the heart of Christ overflows with divine and human love, and since it is abundantly rich with the treasures of all the graces our Redeemer acquired by His life, His sufferings, and His death, it is truly the unfailing fountain of that love which His Spirit pours forth into all the members of His mystical body.</p>

<p>As we meditate today on the love that Christ has for us, we will feel a desire to thank Him for such a great gift and for so much unmerited mercy. As we consider how so very many turn their backs on God, let us remember that often we ourselves are not altogether faithful. That we have many personal weaknesses.</p>

<p>We should turn then to His most loving heart, where we shall find peace. We often need to have recourse to His merciful love, and to seek that peace which is one of the fruits given us by the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>We can say that aspiration Saint Josemar’a liked so much: “Cor Iesu Sacratissimum et Misericors, dona nobis pacem.” Most sweet and merciful heart of Jesus, grant us peace. As we see Jesus so close to our concerns, to our problems, to our ideals, we can say to Him in the words of the <em>Furrow</em>: “I give you thanks, my Jesus, for your decision to become perfect man, with a heart which loves and is most lovable. Which loved unto death and suffered. Which was filled with joy and sorrow. Which delighted in the things of men, and showed us the way to Heaven. Which subjected itself heroically to duty, and acted with mercy. Which watched over the poor and the rich, and cared for the sinner and the just alike. I give you thanks, my Jesus. Give us hearts that will measure up to yours.”</p>

<p>We are told in Saint John that after Jesus had taken the wine, He said, “It is fulfilled” (John 19:30), and bowing His head, He gave up His spirit. We are reminded that joy is compatible with mortification and pain.</p>

<p>Chesterton said that of all the accounts that are given of Jesus on the cross, one that is missing is the account of the joy of Jesus on the cross, in the fact that it is accomplished.</p>

<p>The prophet Isaiah says, “Rejoice with Jerusalem and be glad for her, all you who love her” (Isa. 66:10). Joy is essentially a Christian characteristic. The Church does not fail to remind us that it should be present at every moment of our lives. As we look at the Sacred Heart of Jesus, we can be reminded that that’s the place for us to find our joys.</p>

<p>All people with broken hearts can find solace in the broken heart of Christ on the cross. Fulton Sheen liked to say that when God allows hearts to be broken, it’s because He wants to enter into them a little more. But you just have to give Him all the pieces.</p>

<p>We get a profound joy of being united to Christ. Only in Him can each of us say with Saint Paul, “He loved me and gave Himself up for me” (Gal. 2:20). John Paul II said this should be the source of our greatest happiness, as well as the source of our strength and support, should we have the misfortune to encounter sorrow, undergo suffering, experience misunderstanding, or even to fall into sin.</p>

<p>We can always turn to the one who always loves us. With His infinite love as God, He overcomes every trial, fills our emptiness, forgives all our sins, and eagerly impels us toward a new path that is safe and joyful. The Church wants to remind us that joy is perfectly compatible with mortification and pain.</p>

<p>It is sadness and not penance which is opposed to happiness. The Church can be filled with joy, and each one of us. “Rejoice with Jerusalem,” we’re told, “and be glad for her, all you who love her” (Isa. 66:10). The mortifications that we do do not cast a shadow over our interior joy. We can feel very closely united to Our Lord, so that our lives may reflect once more the suffering that He underwent for our sakes. As well as experiencing great happiness in the attainment of the glory and joy of the resurrection through His passion and cross.</p>

<p>Joy has a spiritual origin, arising from a heart that loves and feels itself loved by God. Saint Paul says to the Philippians, “Rejoice in the Lord always, again I say, rejoice” (Phil. 4:4). This with a cheerfulness that is real happiness. An interior joy which cannot fail to be shown outwardly as well.</p>

<p>Saint Paul VI says it is well known that there are different degrees of this joy. Its most noble expression is the cheerfulness or happiness in its strict sense. When someone at the level of his higher faculties finds satisfaction in the possession of a good which is recognized and loved. All the more reason then that such a one should experience spiritual joy and happiness when his spirit enters into the possession of God who is known and loved as his supreme and immutable good.</p>

<p>Saint Paul VI goes on to say, “Technological society has succeeded in multiplying the occasions of pleasure, but finds great difficulty in giving birth to happiness. For happiness has its origins elsewhere, it is a spiritual thing. Money, comfort, hygiene, material security may often not be lacking, but nevertheless, despite these advantages, boredom, suffering and sadness are frequently to be found supervening in the lives of many people.”</p>

<p>Christians understand these thoughts of the Pope very well. They’re aware that joy and happiness stem from a heart that knows itself to be loved by God, and which in its turn is madly in love with Him. It will be a heart that strives to express its love in deeds. Since it knows that deeds are love, not sweet words. It knows itself to be that of a sinner, so it goes to the source of all forgiveness, to Christ in the sacrament of penance.</p>

<p>When we go to confession, we could think particularly of how the Sacred Heart of Jesus is reaching out to us. Something flowing from His heart into our heart to wash away our sins. Saint Paul says, “Lord, it is with great joy that we offer You the sacrifice that brings everlasting healing.”</p>

<p>Suffering and tribulation are inevitably the lot of everyone on this earth. Everybody needs the consolation coming from the heart of Christ. But suffering of itself alone neither transforms nor purifies. It may even be the cause of rebellion and hatred. Some Christians abandon Our Lord when they meet the cross, because they seek a purely human happiness, free from pain, and accompanied by material wealth.</p>

<p>Our soul will then be more purified, our love stronger. We will realize that joy is inseparable from the cross. It can be useful to remember that Saint Paul’s life was in no way easy or comfortable. Five times he said, “I have received at the hands of the Jews the forty lashes less one. Three times I have been beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three times I have been shipwrecked. A night and a day I have been adrift at sea. On frequent journeys, in danger from rivers, danger from robbers, danger from my own people, danger from Gentiles, danger in the city, danger in the wilderness, danger at sea, danger from false brethren. In toil and hardship, through many a sleepless night, in hunger and thirst, often without food, in cold and exposure” (2 Cor. 11:24–27).</p>

<p>Still, in spite of all this, Saint Paul speaks the truth when he tells us, “I am filled with comfort, with all our affliction I am overjoyed” (2 Cor. 7:4). Saint Josemar’a comments: “If at times we’ve been afraid of penance and atonement, we will be filled with courage at the thought of how short is the time involved, and how great the reward. A prize entirely disproportionate to our own little efforts. Let us cheerfully follow Jesus to Jerusalem, to Calvary, to the cross.”</p>

<p>After all, is it not true that as soon as you cease to be afraid of the cross, of what people call the cross, when you set your will to accept the will of God, then you find happiness, and all your worries, all your sufferings, physical or moral, pass away? During the Mass of this solemnity, we pray: “Father, we rejoice in the gifts of love we have received from the heart of Jesus your Son. Open our hearts to share His life, and continue to bless us with His love.”</p>

<p>We can draw from these moments of prayer the immense joy of considering once again the deep love that Jesus has at this moment for each one of us. A God with a heart of flesh like ours. Jesus of Nazareth still goes about the streets and squares of our cities doing good, just as when He was clothed in mortal flesh among men, helping, healing, consoling, forgiving, and through His sacraments conferring eternal life on us.</p>

<p>Saint Josemar’a says these are the infinite treasures of His heart, which He continues to pour out copiously upon us. Saint Paul teaches that “when He ascended on high, He led a host of captives, and He gave gifts to men” (Eph. 4:8). Every day we receive immeasurable graces, inspirations, and all types of material and spiritual help from the loving heart of Jesus.</p>

<p>However, He does not lord it over us. He begs us to give Him a little love, as He silently shows us His wounds. There may have been times when we have refused Him that love. Maybe often He has hoped that we would show more love, greater fervor, as we make that visit to the Blessed Sacrament or receive Holy Communion.</p>

<p>We need to make a great deal of reparation and atonement to the most Sacred Heart of Jesus for our past life, for so much wasted time, for so much roughness in the way we have dealt with Him, for so much lack of love.</p>

<p>We can say to Him in the words written by Saint Bernard: “I beg you to receive the offering of the years remaining to me. Do not despise, O my God, this heart which is contrite and humble because of all the years that I’ve spent so foolishly. Give me, Lord, the gift of contrition, despite being so clumsy in the way I talk to you and show my love for you. Increase my aversion for my deliberate venial sin. Teach me to offer you in expiation all the physical and moral setbacks of each day, my tiredness at work, and my efforts to finish off my daily tasks the way you would like me to.”</p>

<p>When we see so many people who seem set on fleeing from grace, we can’t remain indifferent. Don’t be content, says Saint Josemar’a, in the way you ask Jesus for pardon for just your own faults. Don’t love Him with your heart alone. Console Him for every offense that has been, that is, or that will be done Him. Love Him with all the strength of all the hearts of all those who have most loved Him. Be daring, telling Him that you are crazier about Him than Mary Magdalene, and either of his two Teresas. That you love Him madly, more than Augustine and Dominic and Francis, more than Ignatius and Xavier.</p>

<p>As always, we go to Jesus through the Immaculate Heart of Mary, asking her to take us little children by the hand, to lead that life of atonement and companionship with Jesus.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice. My immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p>(<em>Proofread</em>)</p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>“‘How can you sleep?’ he asked. ‘Rise up and pray, so that you may not enter into temptation’” (Luke 22:46).</p>

<p>There are many passages in the Gospel speaking about how Our Lord had withdrawn from the crowds and gone on His own to pray (Matt. 14:23; Mark 1:35; Luke 5:16, etc.).</p>

<p>And that’s more clearly thrown into relief at the more important moments of His public ministry: at His Baptism (Luke 3:21-22); at the election of the apostles (Luke 6:12-15); on the occasion of the first multiplication of the loaves (Mark 6:46); at the Transfiguration (Luke 9:28-29). It was a normal thing for Jesus to do.</p>

<p>St. Josemaría says, “At times he spent the whole night in an intimate conversation with his Father. The apostles were filled with love when they saw Christ pray” (Josemaría Escrivá, <em>Christ Is Passing By</em>, Point 119).</p>

<p>Before giving Himself in the Passion, Our Lord makes for the Garden of Gethsemane with His apostles. Our Lord must often have prayed there, because, St. Luke says, “Now he went out, as his custom was, to Mount Olivet (Luke 22:39).</p>

<p>But this time His prayer would be special because the moment of His agony had arrived.</p>

<p>When He comes to Gethsemane, He says to them: “Pray that you may not enter into temptation” (Luke 22:40). Before withdrawing a little to pray, Our Lord asked the Apostles too to pray.</p>

<p>He knows that they soon would be subjected to the temptation of scandal on seeing the Master taken captive. He had already announced it at the Last Supper; but now He warns them that unless they’re found vigilant and praying, they will not pass the test.</p>

<p>Prayer is indispensable for us, for if we neglect our dealings with God, little by little our spiritual life begins to languish.</p>

<p>In the <em>Furrow</em> we’re told, “If you abandon prayer you may at first live on spiritual reserves…and after that, by cheating” (J. Escrivá, <em>Furrow</em>, Point 445).</p>

<p>Bishop Sheen likes to say, “No one ever fell away from God without neglecting their prayer” (Fulton J. Sheen, <em>Characters of the Passion: Lessons on Faith and Trust</em>).</p>

<p>On the other hand, prayer unites us to God. He tells us, “Without me, you can do nothing” (John 15:5).</p>

<p>It is good, said St. Luke, to pray with perseverance, never vacillating (<em>cf</em>. Luke 18:1).</p>

<p>We have to speak with Him a great deal, insistently, in the various circumstances of our lives.</p>

<p>Now, moreover, we walk with Jesus along the Way of the Cross. In <em>The Way,</em> Point 89, we’re told, “without prayer, how difficult it is to accompany him.”</p>

<p>With the example of His own life, the Lord teaches us what our fundamental approach has to be: a continuous filial dialogue with God.</p>

<p>St. Teresa of Ávila has said, “In my view, mental prayer is nothing more but friendly dialogue and frequent solitary conversation with him whom we know loves us” (Teresa of Ávila, <em>Life</em>).</p>

<p>We have to try always to be in the presence of God and to contemplate the mysteries of our faith. This dialogue with God should not be interrupted, and even further, should be carried out in the midst of all our activities.</p>

<p>There are certain periods of the liturgical year when it should be even more intense; in a period of the day, even more intense, during mental prayer: we meditate, we speak in His presence, knowing that He truly sees us and hears us—“that you see me, that you hear me” (<em>Prayer Before Meditation</em>).</p>

<p>The need for prayer, together with the importance of charity, is one of the points most stressed by Our Lord in His public ministry.</p>

<p>“Then he parted from them, and going a stone’s throw-off, he knelt down to pray. ‘Father,’ he said, ‘if it pleases you, take this chalice from before me; only as your will is, not as mine is’” (Luke 22:41-42).</p>

<p>When His spiritual suffering was so intense that it led Him to agony, Our Lord turns to His Father with a prayer brimming with confidence.</p>

<p>He calls Him <em>Abba</em>, “Father,” and says intimate things to Him (Mark 14:36). This is the way that we also should adopt.</p>

<p>In our lives there will be moments of spiritual peace and others of more intense struggle, some moments perhaps of darkness and others of profound sorrow, with temptations to discouragement.</p>

<p>But the sight of Jesus in the Garden always points to the way that we have to proceed—with a persevering and confident prayer.</p>

<p>To move along the road to holiness, but especially when we feel the weight of our weaknesses, we have to recollect ourselves in prayer, in an intimate conversation with Our Lord.</p>

<p>Public prayer, or prayer in common, in which all the faithful take part, is holy and necessary, for God wishes also to see His children praying together (<em>cf</em>. Matt. 18:19-20).</p>

<p>But Our Lord’s commandment to us to “go into your inner room and shut the door upon yourself, and so pray to your Father in secret” (Matt. 6:6) should never be superseded.</p>

<p>The document on the liturgy of the Second Vatican Council, <em>Sacrosanctum Concilium</em>, says the liturgy is public prayer par excellence: “it is the summit toward which the activity of the Church is directed; it is also the fount from which all her power flows. …</p>

<p>“The spiritual life, however, is not limited solely to participation in the liturgy. The Christian indeed is called to pray with others, but he must also enter into their chamber to pray to the Father in secret (<em>cf</em>. Matt. 6:6); furthermore, according to St. Paul, they must ‘pray without ceasing’” (<em>cf</em>. 1 Thess. 5:17).</p>

<p>Prayer in company with other Christians ought also to be personal prayer; while the lips recite it at the proper pace and pauses, the mind gives it all her attention.</p>

<p>In prayer one speaks with God just as one converses with a friend—knowing that He is present, always attentive to what we are saying, listening to us, and replying. It is in such intimate conversation as the one that we are just now trying to have with God.</p>

<p>In these meditations we’re not just listening to a priest speaking. Hopefully we’re taking His words, making them our own, and directing them in a very personal way to Christ, to Jesus.</p>

<p>A priest doesn’t do your prayer for you. It’s your own raising up of the mind and heart to God. We have to try and work at our prayer to improve it all the time.</p>

<p>In that prayer, we throw our soul open to the Lord, to adore Him, to give Him thanks, to ask Him for help, and to go more deeply—as the apostles did—into the divine teachings. “Did not our hearts burn within us as he opened the Scriptures to us as we walked along the way?” (Luke 24:32).</p>

<p>As Our Lord opens the Scriptures to us and shows us new lights in the Scriptures, or in this event, or that event, or in our family, or in our work, hopefully we will continue to see new lights, new beginnings, that will draw us on into a deeper prayer and become more and more convinced of the importance and of the value of this activity.</p>

<p>In <em>The Way</em>, Point 91, we’re told, “You write: ‘To pray is to talk with God. But about what?’ About him, about yourself: joys, sorrows, successes and failures, noble ambitions, daily worries, weaknesses! And acts of thanksgiving and petitions, and Love and reparation. In a word, it’s worth getting to know him and to get to know yourself: ‘to get acquainted!’” (J. Escrivá, <em>The Way</em>, Point 91).</p>

<p>We could ask Our Lord for that grace to yearn to spend time with Him in prayer, and to thank Him for the grace that He has given to us in the past, maybe, years or decades of our life, where He has given us the grace of prayer.</p>

<p>Millions of people in the world have not been given that grace, and so it’s a talent we have to try and use well.</p>

<p>Our prayer ought never to be impersonal, anonymous, dispersed and lost in the crowd; because God, who has redeemed each individual person, wants to maintain a dialogue with each one: at the end of one’s life, salvation or condemnation will depend on the personal response of each one.</p>

<p>Prayer ought to be the dialogue of a particular person—one who has ideals, a specific job, specific friends, who has received specific graces from God, and wants to talk with his God about all of these things.</p>

<p>“When he rose from prayer, he went back to his disciples and found they were sleeping for sorrow.” Our Lord said, “‘How can you sleep? Rise up and pray, so that you may not enter into temptation’” (Luke 22:45-46).</p>

<p>The apostles had ignored Our Lord’s command. There may be many times in our life when we have been like the apostles. Possibly Our Lord has told us specific things, or things He wants us to do, or jobs to fulfill, or people to speak to.</p>

<p>Like the apostles, we’ve ignored His command. He may have told us those things through people, through places, through events, through spiritual direction, through means of formation, but somehow the penny didn’t drop; the message didn’t penetrate.</p>

<p>Our Lord had left them there, close to Himself, so that they would watch and pray, and so not fall into temptation.</p>

<p>But they’d been negligent. Even now, they don’t love Him enough and they allow themselves to be overcome by sleep and weakness, leaving Our Lord unaccompanied, alone, during that time of His agony.</p>

<p>If we ever find we’re overcome with the temptation to sleep, to get drowsy during our prayer, we could try and learn from this situation of the apostles.</p>

<p>We see, ‘What can I do to stay more awake? Can I kneel down, can I walk around the place? Can I do my mental prayer walking around? Do I need some sort of book, so I can look at certain topics or lines from time to time?’</p>

<p>In mental prayer, the focus is on talking with Our Lord. We glance at a line or two to help that conversation. In spiritual reading, our reading is continual reading, but in mental prayer, the reading of a few points is meant to facilitate our prayer.</p>

<p>Sleep, which is like the epitome of human weakness, has allowed an evil sadness to take hold of them: lack of spiritual struggle, abandonment of a life of piety.</p>

<p>There are lessons there for us about the importance of what the <em>Catechism of the Catholic Church</em> calls “the battle for prayer” (<em>Catechism</em>, Point 2725).</p>

<p>Occasionally in our life, we may all experience the battle for prayer. We shouldn’t expect that we can drift into our prayer as on a cloud every time we go to do our mental prayer.</p>

<p>Sometimes we might have to drag ourselves to pray. Or we might feel that our prayer is a comedy show, or we’re getting nothing out of it.</p>

<p>But St. Josemaría is very encouraging about those moments. He says, “Persevere in that prayer” (J. Escrivá, <em>The Way</em>, Point 101).</p>

<p>That prayer might be the best prayer you ever did because that prayer is all done for God and there are no human compensations.</p>

<p>If we maintain a living dialogue with God during each period of prayer, we will avoid getting into the situation of the apostles.</p>

<p>We will frequently resort to the Gospels or some other book that helps us to pray so that it can help us to channel our dialogue, to come closer to Our Lord, for whom no one or nothing can be a substitute. This is the way many saints have been made.</p>

<p>“During all those years,” says St. Teresa of Ávila, ‘except for after Communicating, I never dared begin to pray without a book; my soul was as much afraid to engage in prayer without one, as if it were having to go and fight against a host of enemies. With this help, which was a companion to me and a shield with which I could fight off the many blows of my many thoughts, I felt comforted” (Teresa of Ávila, <em>Life</em>).</p>

<p>It is really encouraging to know how the saints had to fight that battle for prayer.</p>

<p>We have to try and use all the means at our disposal to do our mental prayer in a recollected way. We should do it in the best place, according to our circumstances; and, whenever possible, in front of Our Lord in the tabernacle.</p>

<p>It should be done at the time we have already planned in our schedule for the normal day.</p>

<p>In the prayer we will always be on our guard against distractions. To a large extent, this can mean mortifying our memory and the imagination, keeping distant whatever may impede our attentiveness to God.</p>

<p>We have to avoid having “our senses awake and our soul asleep” (J. Escrivá, <em>The Way</em>, Point 368).</p>

<p>If we fight earnestly against temptations, Our Lord will make it easy for us to take up again the threads of our dialogue with Him. Our guardian angel too has the task of interceding on our behalf.</p>

<p>What’s important is that we do not want to be distracted, or that we have no intention of being willingly distracted during our time of prayer.</p>

<p>Involuntary distractions which may come about in spite of ourselves, and which we try to reject as soon as we’re aware of them, do not lessen the merit or the benefit of prayer. A father or a mother doesn’t get annoyed if the baby keeps uttering meaningless noises because it doesn’t yet know how to speak.</p>

<p>God knows our weaknesses and is patient, but we have to ask Him: Lord, “grant me the spirit of prayer” (Divine Office, <em>Lauds–Monday of Fourth Week of Lent</em>).</p>

<p>It pleases Our Lord when we resolve to improve our mental prayer each day of our lives—even on those occasions when things require more effort, are difficult, or when we feel arid.</p>

<p>“Prayer is not a question of what you say or feel, but of love. And you love when you try to say something to the Lord, even though you might not actually say anything” (J. Escrivá, <em>Furrow</em>, Point 464).</p>

<p>If this is our approach, then our life will be continually enriched and strengthened.</p>

<p>Every person can only truly know themselves with the light of God.</p>

<p>“All that we can know of ourselves through human means (life experiences, psychology, social sciences) are not to be denigrated…But those things give us a limited and partial knowledge of our being.</p>

<p>“We only have access to our profound identity through the light of God, in the regard that God has on us as the Father in heaven.</p>

<p>“This knowledge has a negative aspect, but it is one that leads to something positive. The negative aspect concerns our sin, our profound misery. We don’t recognize it except in the light of God.</p>

<p>“Faced with him, lies are no longer possible; there’s no escaping, no justification, no more masks to cling to. We’re obliged to recognize who we are, with our wounds, our weaknesses, our inconsistencies, our egoism, our hardness of heart, our secret complicities with evil.</p>

<p>“Happily, God is tender and merciful, and this light that is shed on us is done so progressively, as we are able to handle it. God only shows us our sin while simultaneously revealing his forgiveness and his mercy. We discover the sadness of our sinful condition, and also our absolute poverty as creatures” (Jacques Philippe, <em>Nine Days to Rediscover the Joy of Prayer</em>).</p>

<p>All this happens in our prayer. “This step toward truth is necessary: there is no healing without knowledge of the sickness. Only the truth makes us free.</p>

<p>“Fortunately, things don’t stop there. They lead on to something still more profound and infinitely beautiful: beyond our sins and our misery, the discovery of our condition as children of God. God loves us just as we are, with an absolutely unconditional love, and it’s this love that forms our deepest identity.</p>

<p>“More deep and essential than our human limits and the evil that affects us, there is at our base an intact and pure core, our identity as sons and daughters of God” (<em>ibid</em>.).</p>

<p>Prayer is a powerful lamp which throws light on our problems, enables us to get to know people better, and thus to help them on their path towards Christ, and to assign the proper place to the matters which preoccupy us.</p>

<p>Our prayer helps God to be the center of our lives. The more He’s there, the more we’re expecting everything from Him and from Him only, and the more our human relationships will have the chance to be well-adapted and happy.</p>

<p>“Experience shows us that faithfulness to prayer, even if it sometimes goes through difficult periods, moments of dryness, or trying times, progressively leads us to find in God a profound peace, a security, a happiness that makes us free with regard to others and to things” (<em>ibid</em>.).</p>

<p>Prayer locates the soul in an environment of serenity and of peace, which is then transmitted to others. The joy it produces is a foretaste of the happiness in heaven.</p>

<p>No one on this earth has known how to treat Jesus better than His Mother Mary, who spent long hours looking at Him, speaking with Him, handling Him with simplicity and veneration.</p>

<p>If we turn to Our Mother in heaven, we will learn quite quickly to follow Jesus confidently and to speak with Him very closely.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

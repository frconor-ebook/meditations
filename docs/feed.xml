<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,
Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see
me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your
pardon for my sins, and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My
Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel,
intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>We can ask Our Lady to accompany us in that happy hour and to help any
people around us also to find Our Lady and to be with her in that very
special moment.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and
inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I
ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint
Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
Amen.</em></p>

<p>We are told in the Gospel, “Can you not buy two sparrows for a penny?
Yet not one falls to the ground without your Father knowing” (Matt.
10:29).</p>

<p>Mary, may you help me to live that spirit of abandonment in the same way
that you did.</p>

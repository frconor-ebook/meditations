Conor Donnelly</p>

<p>(<em>Proofread</em>)</p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>We’re told in St. Mark that Jesus “was silent and made no answer” (Mark 14:61). For thirty years, Jesus had lived a life of silence. Mary and Joseph were the only ones who knew the mystery of the Son of God.</p>

<p>During His public life, when He returned to His hometown, His relatives were disconcerted by His wisdom and His miracles. They had known Him only from His exemplary life of work.</p>

<p>During the three years of His public life, we see how He withdraws into the silence of prayer, to be alone with His Father God. He withdraws from the superficial clamor of the multitude that wants to make Him their king. He performs miracles without ostentation, asking people He cures to refrain from publicizing His powers.</p>

<p>We see that one of the characteristics of the life of Christ was silence. His silence before His enemies in the Passion is very moving: “He was silent and made no answer,” we’re told (Mark 14:61). In the face of so many false accusations, He makes no defense.</p>

<p>St. Jerome comments, “Our God and Savior, who because of his mercy had redeemed the world, allows himself to be led to his death like a lamb, without a word of complaint or self-defense. The silence of Jesus obtains pardon for the protest and excuse of Adam” (Jerome, <em>Commentary on St. Mark’s Gospel</em>).</p>

<p>Jesus says nothing during the hearings before Herod and Pilate. We see Him standing silent at their preference for Barabbas in front of His hate-filled enemies.</p>

<p>We’re told in St. Matthew: “When he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he made no answer. Then Pilate said to him, ‘Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?’ But he gave him no answer, not even to a single charge, so that the governor wondered greatly” (Matt. 27:12-14).</p>

<p>The silence of Jesus in the face of human passions, before the sins which are committed every day by humanity, is not a silence of anger. It is a silence that’s full of patience and love.</p>

<p>The silence of Calvary is that of a God who comes to redeem all men by His indescribable agony of the Cross. The silence of Jesus in the tabernacle is that of a love which waits for a response. It’s the patient silence of one who treasures our attentions.</p>

<p>Christ’s silence during His earthly life represents interior strength and sense of purpose. One writer says, “Those who complain continually about their misfortunes or their bad luck should look at the example of Our Lord. Those who proclaim their problems to the four winds should consider the behavior of Christ. Those who feel compelled to explain and excuse their actions, who wait anxiously for praise or approval, should take note of Christ, who says nothing.</p>

<p>“We will imitate him when we learn to accept life’s duties and worries without sterile complaints, when we confront our personal problems without dumping them in someone else’s lap, when we face squarely the consequences of our actions, when we do our work for the glory of God without looking for earthly praise” (F. Suarez, <em>The Two Faces of Silence, Nuestro Tiempo</em>).</p>

<p>“Jesus says nothing,” we’re told in Scripture. We have to learn to say nothing on many occasions. At times vanity will have us say things which should have been kept locked in the soul.</p>

<p>The silent figure of Christ is the ever-present model to reproach empty or useless words. His example will lead us to remain silent before calumny and rumor. The Prophet Isaiah says, “In silence and in hope will be your fortitude and your courage” (Isa. 30:15). He encourages us that our fortitude is grounded in silence and in hope.</p>

<p>At the same time, Our Lord doesn’t always remain silent. He teaches us that sometimes we have to speak out when it’s necessary, with charity and with fortitude, avoiding the silence of consent.</p>

<p>There is a silence that can collaborate with lying, a silence that can cooperate with cowardice, a silence which springs from the love of comfort and the fear of complicating one’s life. You can close your eyes to what is disagreeable. You can put off making a fraternal correction that ought to be made at home or at work.</p>

<p>The word of Jesus is full of authority as He faces injustice and abuse. In St. Matthew we’re told, “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour widows’ houses and for a pretense you make long prayers” (Matt. 23:14).</p>

<p>St. John the Baptist was “the voice of one crying in the wilderness” (Matt. 3:3). He teaches us to say everything that must be said, even though it may seem as if we too are crying in the wilderness.</p>

<p>Our Lord will not allow our words to be wasted. It’s important that we say what has to be said, without worrying ourselves about the immediate consequences.</p>

<p>If each Christian were to speak in conformity with the faith, we would surely change the world. We can’t sit by silently in the face of such crimes of abortion and the degradation of marriage and the family. Nor can we surrender to those forces that would seek to remove God from the formation of the young.</p>

<p>We can’t be silent at attacks upon the Pope and Our Lady, or upon institutions of the Church. To be silent when we should be speaking out can be a way of collaborating with evil, because others might think that our silence means consent.</p>

<p>If Catholics were to speak out where there is need, if they were to boycott anti-Catholic publications or literature, it would be more difficult for those enterprises to prosper.</p>

<p>In our prayer today, we can ask Our Lord for the grace to speak out when necessary. At times, those occasions will be when we’re with a little group of our friends, coming or going to school or to work. In letters to the editor, we can write in praise of a good article or to criticize a bad one.</p>

<p>We should always act with charity. It’s worthwhile to remember that true charity always goes hand in hand with fortitude. We need to exercise good manners, always working with the intention of bringing souls to Jesus Christ. Yet we should act at the same time with the fortitude of Our Lord.</p>

<p>If upon realizing that his life was in danger, St. John the Baptist had remained silent or retired to the sidelines of public affairs, he would not have been beheaded by Herod. But John was not that kind of man. He was not “a reed shaken by the wind” (Matt. 11:7). He was true to his vocation and also to his principles to the end.</p>

<p>If he had remained silent, he could have lived a few more years, but his disciples would not have been the first to follow Our Lord. He would not have “prepared and made straight the way of the Lord,” as we’re told by Isaiah (Isa. 40:3). He would not have lived up to his vocation. His life would have been bereft of meaning.</p>

<p>Probably Our Lord is not asking us to suffer a martyr’s death, but He is asking for courage and fortitude in facing up to the demands of ordinary life. Perhaps He is asking us to stop watching a bad TV show or to cease putting off an apostolic conversation.</p>

<p>We can’t allow ourselves to hide behind excuses when there is a lot of apostolic work to be done. We have to act with optimism, loving the world and the good that is in it, while seeking to increase that goodness. We can do this with the example of a joyful family and of the youthful love that is born of holy purity.</p>

<p>There are other kinds of cowardly silence which we have to struggle against: the silence we might maintain with the person next to us. But God has put that person there so that we might be a beacon of light for him or for her.</p>

<p>It’s hard to imagine that we can be courageous at all in this life if we are not courageous first with ourselves, especially when we’re talking with our spiritual director, to say the things that need to be said.</p>

<p>Many of our friends, on seeing that we truly practice what we preach, will be attracted to the faith. Centuries ago, many people converted after witnessing the martyrdom of the first Christians.</p>

<p>We can learn a lot from Our Lord’s silence. We’re told in the Psalms, “My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When shall I come and behold the face of God?” (Ps. 42:2). God lives in our midst and often in a very silent way.</p>

<p>Throughout the Old Testament, God makes known His intention of having an ongoing presence among men. The “tent of meeting” was the first temple to God in the desert. Upon the tent there came to rest a cloud which symbolized the glory of God and His presence.</p>

<p>“Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle” (Ex. 40:34). The cloud was a sign of the divine presence (<em>cf</em>. Num. 12:5; 1 Kings 8:10-11).</p>

<p>Much later, the Temple of Jerusalem was the place where the Israelites worshiped God (<em>cf</em>. Ex. 23:15-17). It was the place they had been longing for while they were in the desert.</p>

<p>They would recall the enthusiasm of old when they would go to the house of the Lord, singing songs of joy and praise: “How lovely is your dwelling place, O Lord of hosts! My soul longs, yes, faints for the courts of the Lord; my heart and flesh sing for joy to the living God” (Ps. 84:1-2).</p>

<p>To be far from the sanctuary was to be deprived of true happiness. “My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When shall I come and behold the face of God?” (Ps. 42:2).</p>

<p>In the fullness of time, the Word became flesh. In the moment of the Incarnation the power of the Most High overshadowed Our Lady (<em>cf</em>. Luke 1:35). This is an expression of the omnipotence of God.</p>

<p>Following upon the Incarnation, Our Lady, the Virgin, became the Tabernacle of God. “The Word of God dwelt among us,” we’re told in St. John (John 1:14).</p>

<p>St. John uses a Greek verb for “dwelt” which originally meant “to pitch one’s tent,” hence, to live in a place. “The careful reader of Scripture will immediately think of the tabernacle, or tent, in the period of the exodus from Egypt, where God showed his presence before all the people of Israel through certain signs of his glory, such as the cloud covering the tent.</p>

<p>“In many passages of the Old Testament it is announced that God ‘will dwell in the midst of the people’ (<em>cf</em>. Jer. 7:3; Ezek. 43:9; Sir. 24:8). These signs of God’s presence, first in the pilgrim Tent of the Ark in the desert and then in the Temple of Jerusalem, are followed by the most wonderful form of God’s presence among us—Jesus Christ, perfect God and perfect Man, in whom the ancient promise is fulfilled in a way that far exceeded men’s greatest expectations. Also the promise made through Isaiah about the ‘Emmanuel’ or ‘God with us’ (Isa. 7:14; <em>cf</em>. Matt. 1:23) is completely fulfilled through this dwelling of the Incarnate Son of God among us” (<em>The Navarre Bible</em>, St. John).</p>

<p>From that time onwards, we can say with exactitude that God lives among us. We can be next to Him every day, closer to Him than anyone might imagine possible—God truly dwelling among us.</p>

<p>From the moment of the Incarnation we can affirm that God is with us in the personal presence of Jesus Christ. As both true God and true Man, Jesus is closer to us than any other being. Jesus is “God with us.”</p>

<p>In earlier times, the Israelites would say that God was “with them.” Now we can say this in a very literal sense.</p>

<p>When Christ traveled about Palestine, He made an effort to preach in many towns. “When Jesus had finished these parables,” we’re told, “he went away from there” (Matt. 13:53). God left one town to go and meet other people.</p>

<p>When the priest consecrates the host during the Mass, he brings Christ to the altar with His Holy Humanity. He is there in the Eucharist with a special presence for as long as the sacramental species last.</p>

<p>This presence affects the Body of Christ in a direct way and the Three Persons of the Holy Trinity in an indirect way. The Word is tied to Christ’s humanity, while the Father and the Holy Spirit are related by the mutual immanence of their divine Persons (<em>cf</em>. Council of Trent, Decree, <em>De Sanctissima Eucharistia</em>).</p>

<p>Christ is really present in the Tabernacle with His Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity. It can be said quite literally that ‘God is here, close to me.’ We could make that act of faith: “My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me, that you hear me.”</p>

<p>Down through the centuries the Church has developed a precise way of describing the Eucharistic presence, often requiring such exact definition to counter erroneous beliefs.</p>

<p>The Eucharistic presence is a <em>real</em> presence, a silent presence. It is not symbolic, nor does it signify or insinuate any image.</p>

<p>It is not fictitious, or merely the product of the imagination or the will. It is <em>substantial</em> because the words of the Consecration spoken by the priest change the substance of bread and the wine into the substance of the Body and Blood of Christ.</p>

<p>Paul VI says, “Every theological explanation which seeks some understanding of this mystery must, in order to be in accord with Catholic faith, maintain that in the reality itself, independently of our mind, the bread and wine have ceased to exist after the Consecration, so that it is the adorable Body and Blood of Our Lord Jesus that from then on are really before us under the sacramental species of bread and wine…” (Paul VI, Apostolic Letter, <em>Credo of the People of God</em>, Point 25, June 30, 1968).</p>

<p>In the encyclical <em>Mysterium Fidei</em>, Paul VI says, “As a result of transubstantiation, the species of bread and wine…contain a new ‘reality’ which we may justly term ‘ontological.’ Not that there lies under those species what was already there before, but something quite different; and that not only because of the faith of the Church, but in objective reality… (<em>cf</em>. Paul VI, Encyclical, <em>Mysterium Fidei,</em> Point 46, September 3, 1965).</p>

<p>Jesus is silently present in our Tabernacles whether or not we take advantage of this amazing wonder. He is there silently, with His Body and His Blood, His Soul and His Divinity. God made Man. He could not be closer.</p>

<p>The Church possesses the Author of all grace and the cause of our sanctification. We may venture to say that the Eucharistic presence of Christ is the sacramental prolongation of the Incarnation.</p>

<p>From the Tabernacle Jesus invites us to bring to Him our concerns and our petitions. In the <em>visit to the Blessed Sacrament</em> and other acts of worship offered to the Holy Eucharist, we give thanks for this great gift.</p>

<p>There we can go to find new strength, to tell Jesus that we miss Him, to tell Him that we need Him very much. “The Eucharist is reserved in the churches and oratories [to serve as] the spiritual center of a religious community or of a parish, and [indeed] of the universal Church and of all humanity, since beneath the appearance of the species, Christ is contained: the invisible Head of the Church, the Redeemer of the world, the center of all hearts, ‘by whom,’ says St. Paul, ‘all things are and by whom we exist’ (1 Cor. 8:6)” (<em>ibid</em>., Point 68).</p>

<p>It has been the constant practice of the Church to adore Christ’s silent presence in the Tabernacle. If we recall how much reverence the Israelites had for their “tent of meeting” in the desert and for the Temple at Jerusalem, which were figures or images of reality, how much more reverence should we have for Christ truly present in the Tabernacle?</p>

<p>In the first centuries of the Church, the main reason for reserving the Sacred Species was for the sake of those who were not able to get to Mass, especially the sick and the dying, and also for those in prison due to religious persecution. The Sacrament of the Lord was brought with piety and fervor so that these Christians might also receive Communion.</p>

<p>Later, faith in the real presence of Christ led to the cult of the Blessed Sacrament, and the Church authoritatively approved those practices. The Council of Trent declared, “There is, therefore, no room left for doubt that all the faithful of Christ in accordance with a custom always received in the Catholic Church offer in veneration the worship of <em>latria</em> which is due to the true God, to this most Holy Sacrament” (Council of Trent, <em>Session XIII</em>).</p>

<p>In the thirteenth century, St. Thomas Aquinas composed a Eucharistic hymn which embodies the faith of the Church in a faithful and pious manner. We should make this hymn our own so as to nourish our piety and give honor to the Blessed Sacrament.</p>

<p>The hymn states: “O Godhead hid, devoutly I adore you, Who truly are within the forms before me; To you my heart I bow with bended knee, As failing quite in contemplating thee” (Prayer in Adoration Before the Blessed Sacrament, <em>Adore te Devote</em>).</p>

<p>Here we have all the truths of the faith. We have understanding with humility and thanksgiving, amazement before the power of God, surprise at the extent of His mercy. With the confidence gained by having Him so close by, we can ask Our Lord for His grace to unite ourselves to His most holy will.</p>

<p>Next to the silent Tabernacle, we can learn how to love. There we will draw the strength necessary to remain faithful. We’ll find consolation in times of sorrow.</p>

<p>He silently waits for us and He rejoices when we are next to Him, even if only for a short while. There Jesus waits for His people who suffer the contradictions of this life. He comforts them with the warmth of His understanding and His love.</p>

<p>It is in the Tabernacle that the words of Our Lord come to life, specifically those words where He says, “Come to me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest” (Matt. 11:28).</p>

<p>We should not fail to visit Him. He is waiting for us. He has many gifts prepared for us.</p>

<p>Mary, we turn to you, Comfort of the afflicted, Cause of our joy. We ask you for the grace to learn from the silence of Our Lord in His public life, and also in the Tabernacle.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

Conor Donnelly</p>

<p><em>(Proofread)</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here. That you see me, that you hear me.</em></p>

<p><em>I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins, and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful.</em></p>

<p><em>My immaculate mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>John Fisher was ordained a priest in 1491. He held several teaching posts at the University of Cambridge, and at the same time was responsible for the spiritual direction of Queen Margaret, the mother of Henry VIII. He later occupied the chair of theology which the queen had endowed at Cambridge.</p>

<p>Early in 1504, he was named Vice Chancellor of Cambridge University, and at the end of the year was consecrated Bishop of Rochester, the smallest and poorest diocese in England.</p>

<p>Two days later, he was appointed to office as a member of the King’s Council. Thomas More studied literature and philosophy at Oxford and law at the New Inn. In 1504, he was elected a member of parliament and held several public offices. He earned great prestige because of his knowledge of the law and his integrity.</p>

<p>Although his professional life was intensely time-consuming, he always found time for his family, which was his most important concern, and for his literary and historical studies. He published various books and essays. In 1529, he was appointed Lord Chancellor of England, in spite of having made it clear to the King that he would not agree to the dissolution of the King’s marriage.</p>

<p>Taking a full interest in the problems of his day, he dedicated himself to his work with the desire of implementing the laws and institutions of his times with a Christian approach. Both men were beheaded in 1535 for refusing to recognize the supremacy of Henry VIII over the Church in England and the annulment of the King’s marriage.</p>

<p>In England in 1534, all citizens who had come of age were ordered to take the oath unto the Act of Succession, which acknowledged the union of Henry VIII with Anne Boleyn as a marriage. The King proclaimed himself supreme head of the Church in England and denied any authority to the Pope. John Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, and Thomas More, Chancellor of the Realm, both refused to take the oath. They were imprisoned in 1534 and were beheaded the following year.</p>

<p>At a time when many acceded to the royal will, it would scarcely have been noticed if these two had taken the oath. They would have saved their lives, their property, their positions, as so many others did. Both of these men, however, were true to the faith, even to the point of martyrdom.</p>

<p>They were able to give their lives when the time came, because they were of the kind who lived their vocation day by day, giving daily witness to the faith, sometimes in matters that might have seemed of little or no consequence.</p>

<p>Thomas More is a man very close to ourselves because he was an ordinary Christian who knew how to combine, in perfect unity of life, his vocation as the father of a family, with his profession as a lawyer, and later as Lord Chancellor of England. He was at home in the world. He loved all the human realities that formed the framework of his life in the place and position where God wanted him to be.</p>

<p>At the same time, he lived such detachment from earthly things and had such love for the Cross that we can say he drew all of his strength from it. He was in the habit of meditating on a passage of the passion of Our Lord every Friday. When his children or his wife complained about ordinary difficulties and annoyances, he told them they could not expect to go to heaven on feather beds.</p>

<p>He reminded them of the sufferings Our Lord had undergone and that the servant is not greater than his master. As well as using the ordinary little pin pricks and routine mishaps of the day as a means of identifying himself with the Cross, More offered up other penances.</p>

<p>Some days he wore a hair shirt, a garment of rough cloth next to his skin. One writer says he continued this practice during his imprisonment in the Tower of London, in spite of the cold, the damp, and all the privations he had to put up with during those long months. It was here in the Cross that he found his strength.</p>

<p>We are Christians who follow Christ closely in the midst of the world and bear witness to Him, generally silently. We can ask ourselves also, do we find strength in being detached from earthly things and through the daily practice of mortification, penance, and prayer.</p>

<p>When Thomas More had to resign his post as Lord Chancellor, he gathered his family together to talk to them about the future that awaited them and how they would manage financially. He summarized his whole career, saying, “I have been brought up at Oxford, at the Inn of Chancery, at Lincoln’s Inn, and also at the King’s Court. From the lowest to the highest. Yet I now have little above one hundred pounds a year. If we are to continue together, all must become contributors. But my counsel is that it shall not be best for us to fall to the lowest fare first.”</p>

<p>Then he suggested to them a gradual descent, reminding them how it is possible to be content at every level. One writer says, if they were unable to support themselves at even the lowest level, that one at which he had managed to live while in Oxford, he said with peace and good humor, “Then we may yet with bags and wallets go a-begging together, and hoping for, for pity, some good folks will give us of their charity, and so still keep company and be merry together.” He never allowed anything to disturb the unity and peace of his family, even when he was away or in prison.</p>

<p>He lived detached from things when he had them, and with great joy when he did not possess or even have access to even the most indispensable necessities of life. He was always able to rise above circumstances. He knew how to celebrate important events even behind prison bars. A contemporary biographer tells us that while he was imprisoned in the Tower, he would dress more elegantly on important feast days, so far as his meager wardrobe would permit. He always remained cheerful and good-humored, even at the moment when he was ascending the scaffold, because he relied firmly on prayer.</p>

<p>“Good Lord, the things that I pray for,” he said, “give me your grace to labor for.” He did not expect God to give him those things that, with just a little effort on his part, he could obtain for himself. He worked all his life so as to become a lawyer of great prestige before being appointed Lord Chancellor. He never forgot, however, the need for prayer. Even though at times, and particularly in circumstances as dramatic as those leading up to his execution, it was not easy for him.</p>

<p>During those days, he wrote a long prayer in which many of the pious and moving considerations made by a man who knew he was about to die. He exclaimed, “Grant me, my Lord, a desire to be with you, not so as to avoid the calamities of this world, nor even to avoid the pains of purgatory, nor those of hell, nor to gain the joys of heaven, not out of consideration for my own profit, but simply through true love for you.”</p>

<p>St. Thomas More is always presented to us as a man of prayer. St. Josemaría says in <em>The Furrow</em>, “This enabled him to be faithful whatever the circumstances, to his commitments as a citizen and as a Christian. Thereby living a perfect unity of life. This is how we too have to be. A Catholic without prayer is the same as a soldier without arms.” We could ask ourselves, well how is my relationship with Christ?</p>

<p>Do I try to grow each day in intimacy with Him? Does my prayer influence the rest of my day? He prayed, “Give me the grace, Good Lord, to set the world at naught. To have my mind well united to you. To not depend on the changing opinions of others. So that I may think joyfully of God, and tenderly implore your help. So that I may lean on God’s strength and make an effort to love Him. So as to thank Him ceaselessly for His benefits. So as to redeem the time I have wasted.”</p>

<p>The saint wrote these words in the margin of the Book of Hours he had with him in the Tower of London. They were days in which he gave himself over completely to contemplating the Passion, and in this way to preparing himself for his own death in union with the death Christ suffered on the cross.</p>

<p>Saint Thomas’s last moments on earth were seen not only by God. His love for God had been clear to everyone around him, day by day in his family life, in his simple, pleasant manner, in the way he carried out his profession as a lawyer, in holding the highest post in the land, that of Lord Chancellor.</p>

<p>It was through fulfilling the duties of each day, some of which were important, others less important, that he sanctified himself and helped others to find God. Among many other examples of his effective apostolate, he has left us that of the apostolate he did with his son-in-law, who had fallen into the Lutheran heresy.</p>

<p>He said to his daughter, “I have borne a long time with your husband. I have reasoned and argued with him on these points of religion, and given to him my poor fatherly counsel, but I perceive none of this is able to call him home, and therefore, Meg, I will no longer dispute with him, but will give him over, and get me to God to pray for him.”</p>

<p>More’s words and prayers were effective, as soon afterwards, Roper returned to the fullness of the faith and afterwards suffered much through remaining loyal to the Catholic faith. Saint Thomas More remains among us as a living example for our conduct as Christians. He is the fruitful seed of peace and joy.</p>

<p>As was his passage on earth, at home among his family and friends, in the law courts, in the university chair, at court, in the embassies, in parliament, and in government. He is also a silent patron of England who shed his blood in defense of the unity of the Church and of the spiritual power of the Vicar of Christ.</p>

<p>One writer says, “As the blood of Christians is a germinating seed, the blood of Thomas More slowly seeps into and soaks the souls of those who approach him, drawn by his prestige, his sweetness of character, and his strength. More will be the silent apostle of the return to the faith of a whole nation.”</p>

<p>We can ask John Fisher and Thomas More to teach us to imitate them in their Christian coherence, so that we may live as God wants us to in all things, both great and small, whatever the circumstances of our lives. The opening prayer of today’s Mass says, “In the death of your martyrs, O God, we see the noblest of testimonies to the true faith. Grant we pray that strengthened by the prayers of Saint Thomas More and Saint John Fisher, we may bear witness in our lives to the faith we confess with our lips.”</p>

<p>When we contemplate the lives of these great saints, also of the English-speaking world, we could note the first necessary step in persevering to the end of the way: that desire of wanting to be a saint. We could ask them for those real and effective desires. The psalms we read, “My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. As a deer longs for flowing streams, so longs my soul for you, O God. When shall I come and behold the face of God?” (Ps. 42:2–3).</p>

<p>The deer attempting to quench its thirst with water is the psalmist’s symbolic way of describing the desire for God present in the heart of an upright person. A thirst and vehement desire for God. Such is the aspiration of one who is not content to accept worldly success as the satisfaction for human ambitions. We’re told in Saint Matthew’s Gospel, “What will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his life?” (Matt. 16:26).</p>

<p>Our Lord’s question forces us to take a radical look at the broad horizon of our life to which only God gives ultimate meaning. “My soul thirsts for God.” Saint Josemaría says, “The saints are not abnormally gifted people, nor have they necessarily been completely perfect since childhood. They are men and women with a great desire to belong to God completely, despite their defects.” We could each ask ourselves, “Have I a true desire to be a saint?”</p>

<p>The answer most assuredly would be in the affirmative, yes. But our reply should not be as to a theoretical question, he says, “Because for some, holiness is unattainable, something to do with ascetical theology, but not a real goal, a living reality.”</p>

<p>“We want to make it happen with the help of God’s grace. So longs my soul for you, O God.” We have to start by making the desire for holiness flourish in our own soul, telling Our Lord, “I want to be a saint, or at least when I experience my softness and weakness, I want to want to be a saint.”</p>

<p>To banish doubt and make holiness more than an empty word, we need to turn and look at Christ. The Second Vatican Council says, “The Lord Jesus, the divine teacher and model of all perfection, preached holiness of life, of which he is the author and maker, to each and every one of his disciples without distinction” (Lumen Gentium, 40).</p>

<p>“You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect” (Matt. 5:48). He has taken the initiative. If He had not, the possibility of being a saint would never have occurred to us. Jesus put it to us as a command, “Be perfect.” It is not surprising that the Church makes sure her children hear these resounding words.</p>

<p>Therefore, all the faithful, says the Second Vatican Council, are invited and obliged to holiness and the perfection of their own state of life. Think then how deep our desire for holiness has to be. In Scripture, the prophet Daniel is “a man of desires” (Dan. 9:23).</p>

<p>It would be wonderful if we were all worthy of such a title. The first thing that souls must do if they embark on the path of holiness, says St. Teresa, is really to want to be saints, whatever may come, whatever may happen to them, however hard they may have to labor, whoever may complain of them, whether they reach their goal or die on the road.</p>

<p>In <em>The Furrow</em>, we’re told, “Allow your soul to be consumed by desires, desires for loving, for forgetting yourself, for sanctity, for heaven. Do not stop to wonder whether the time will come for seeing them accomplished, as some pseudo-advisor might suggest. Make them more fervent each day, for the Holy Spirit says that He is pleased with men of desires.”</p>

<p>“Let your desires be operative and put them into practice in your daily tasks.” We should examine our conscience to see if our desires for holiness are sincere and effective, and furthermore to see if we take them as something obligatory for a faithful Christian, as the Second Vatican Council states, in response to God’s desires.</p>

<p>This response could reveal the reason for so much apathy and weakness in our interior struggle. In <em>The Way</em>, we’re told, “You tell me yes, you want to. Very good, but do you want to as a miser longs for gold, as a mother loves her child, as a worldling craves for honors, or as a wretched sensualist seeks his pleasure?”</p>

<p>“No, then you don’t really want to.” We could try to develop these desires with the virtue of hope. One can only effectively desire something when there is a hope of attaining it. If we consider some aim to be impossible and not for us, we will not really desire it. Our theological hope rests on God.</p>

<p>Softness and lukewarmness can destroy our desires for holiness. There is need for vigilance. The conversion of Cornelius the Centurion, mentioned in today’s Mass, in the first reading, shows that God is no respecter of persons. Saint Peter explains to the others what has happened. The Holy Spirit, we’re told in the Acts, “fell upon them just as on us at the beginning” (Acts 11:15).</p>

<p>There are no limits or barriers to the power of the Holy Spirit. This is true in our case, just as it was for Cornelius, who was not a Jew by race or nation. On the one hand, we have to want to be saints, but we must also take into account that we’re told in the Psalms that, “Unless the Lord builds the house, those who build it labor in vain” (Ps. 127:1).</p>

<p>Humility leads us to count always above all on God’s grace. To this we add our efforts to acquire virtues and practice them continuously, and our apostolic zeal, since our concept of personal holiness should not be one which ignores others or which is indifferent to charity. That would be contradictory.</p>

<p>There is our desire to be with Christ on the Cross. That is, to be mortified, not rejecting sacrifice in small things, and if need be in big things. We should be forewarned about approaching God with reservations and without renunciation, trying to make the love of God compatible with what is not pleasing to Him.</p>

<p>We should be alert in developing our desires for holiness continually through prayer, by asking God for the ability to struggle each day, to discover in our examination of conscience the places where our love is growing cold. Saint John of the Cross says, “Desire for holiness is real when we fulfill acts of piety with refinement, not omitting them or delaying them for any reason whatever, refusing to be led by our moods and feelings.”</p>

<p>Because the soul truly in love with God never fails through laziness to do all in its power to seek God’s Son the Beloved. And having done all it could, is still not satisfied as it thinks it has done nothing. The virtue of humility enables us to avoid a sense of self-satisfaction with what we have done, and not to be content with ineffectual desires.</p>

<p>It lets us see how we can do more to show the sincerity of our desires with deeds of love, ensuring that our sins, offenses, and negligences don’t frustrate our expectations. Humility doesn’t clip the wings of our desires, but rather helps us to understand the need to have recourse to God to make them come true. With God’s grace, we can do all in our power to make virtue grow in our soul by removing obstacles, fleeing from occasions of sin, and bravely resisting temptations. We should avoid discouragement in the struggle to improve.</p>

<p>We have to count on time and on God’s grace. “My soul thirsts for God, for the living God” (Ps. 42:2). St. Josemaría says, “Is this thirst compatible with our experience of our defects and even our falls? Yes, because saints are not those who have never sinned, but those who have always got up again.” Refusal to pursue holiness and seeing ourselves full of defects is a hidden form of pride and obvious cowardice which will end up stifling our desires for God. “Feeling easily deflated,” says St. Josemaría, “and lying down under adversity is characteristic of cowardly souls lacking the firm virtue of trusting in God’s promises.”</p>

<p>Abandoning God, ceasing to struggle because of our defects when there is opposition is a serious mistake. A very subtle and dangerous temptation, which can lead us to that form of pride called pusillanimity, lack of courage and strength to bear misfortune or undertake large enterprises. We may need to rid ourselves of false illusions in wanting to be saints in a day. That would be impossible, unless God decided to perform a miracle, which He has no reason to do, since He gives us all the graces we need by ordinary means in a continuous and progressive way.</p>

<p>One writer says, “An effective desire for holiness consists in a conscious and determined effort to use the necessary means to attain holiness.” If desire is lacking, nothing can be done. One doesn’t even try. Desires alone are not enough. We must be patient then, and not try to banish in a day the many habits we have picked up in neglecting our spiritual health. “As the deer longs for flowing streams, so my soul longs for you, O God” (Ps. 42:1). We could almost hear those words on the lips and heart of St. Thomas More and Bishop John Fisher.</p>

<p>Let us try to keep our desire for God alive, to enkindle the flame of faith and hope in the fire of the love of God, enlivening our virtues and burning away our miseries. We will quench our thirst for holiness with the water that springs up to eternal life. And always our mother will be there to help us.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice.

Conor Donnelly</p>

<p>(<em>Proofread</em>)</p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>“Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the desert, to be tempted by the devil. And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, afterwards he was hungry. And the tempter coming said to him: ‘If you be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.’ He answered and said: ‘It is written: not in bread alone does man live, but in every word that proceeds from the mouth of God’” (Matt. 4:1-4).</p>

<p>We find the devil mentioned very strongly in this particular moment of the Gospel.</p>

<p>Some people tend to laugh at the very suggestion of the existence of the devil, but his presence in Scripture and in the <em>Catechism of the Catholic Church</em> is very clear. Often, it’s his most powerful weapon that people ignore him, and so he acts like a thief. But he exists and he tempted Christ.</p>

<p>He is the enemy of our redemption. He tempted and made our first parents sin. He disobeyed God and is eager to get man to do the same. He’s envious of the relationship between man and God and seeks to destroy it. Our Lord talks a lot about him, and so we can’t ignore him.</p>

<p>We have a lot of faith in God. It’s good also that we have faith in the devil. But the fact that he tempts us and bothers us on a daily basis doesn’t mean that we need to lose our peace, because we count on the help of Our Father God.</p>

<p>We can always be positive in our fight. We need not look on temptation as a burden. Our Lord Himself underwent temptation. We overcome temptation. We don’t undergo temptation.</p>

<p>We can also count on the fact that in the face of temptation we are never alone. We have the Communion of Saints.</p>

<p>Our Lord wants us in these moments to acknowledge our humility, our weakness, and to run with more intensity to prayer and flee from the occasions; at the same time, counting on them, because they are part of the way to sanctity.</p>

<p>Our Lord has already triumphed. We have all the means. We can unite ourselves to His victory.</p>

<p>Every temptation that we overcome strengthens our soul and increases our grace.</p>

<p>Our Lord often was alone in solitude with God. His praying reminds us of the need we too have, to often seek those moments of solitude where we can be alone with God and pray.</p>

<p>“Count it all for joy,” says St. James, “when you fall into different temptations. Knowing that the trying of your faith works patience” (James 1:2-3).</p>

<p>There are many times in Scripture where the benefit of temptation is mentioned.</p>

<p>“Blessed is the person,” also says St. James, “that endures temptation; for when he has been proven he shall receive the crown of life” (James 1:12). Temptation is a pathway to glory and to victory.</p>

<p>St. Paul says, “He that thinks himself strong enough to stand, let him take heed lest he fall” (1 Cor. 10:12).</p>

<p>“God is faithful,” says St. Paul, “who will not suffer you to be tempted above what you’re able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that you may be able to bear it” (1 Cor. 10:13).</p>

<p>The devil is the father of lies (John 8:44). Lying is behaving like a child of Satan.</p>

<p>But when we realize that we’ve invited the devil into our house or that he’s cornered us in his cave, our response has to be to run back to God with an act of contrition. Those acts of contrition can be a constant in our life.</p>

<p>Did Jesus need to be tempted? Could He be tempted?</p>

<p>In some ways He didn’t need to be tempted. He was the God-Man. But by allowing Himself to be tempted by the devil, He instructs us how to overcome those temptations.</p>

<p>Tempting means testing: trying to improve something one is not sure about. It involves the possibility that the results may go one way or another.</p>

<p>As God, Jesus could not be tempted, but the devil did not know or was not sure that He was God. It’s unlikely that the devil knew about the doctrine of the Blessed Trinity, which was first revealed to Our Lady. As God-Man, there’s no possibility of failing the test. The devil did not know this.</p>

<p>Why did the God-Man agree to this Himself?</p>

<p>Not to be strengthened, as we might need due to weakness, but it was for our instruction that He allowed Himself to be tempted as we will be tempted and tested. And that testing is not bad; otherwise, He would not have agreed to it. Great benefit can come from that.</p>

<p>St. Padre Pio said that if we knew the merit that comes from overcoming temptation, we would welcome temptations (<em>cf</em>. Padre Pio, <em>Epistolario</em>).</p>

<p>There’s a great good to be gained from it. If we are to be like Him, we will go through the same.</p>

<p>If we are trying to lead holy lives, it’s very logical that the devil will try to knock us off our perch. We’re a big target for him. He wins a great battle if he can bring us down.</p>

<p>Our Lord has come to overcome the devil. The purpose of the Incarnation in some ways was to undo all the evil that the devil had done. St. John says this in his Letter: it was “to undo all that the devil has done that the Son of God appeared” (1 John 3:8).</p>

<p>It’s appropriate that Christ arranges a meeting with the devil, a duel, so that His overcoming Satan will be a pledge to our future success. It was truly a battle of the giants.</p>

<p>In the first temptation, we’re told that the devil tempted Jesus to eat bread: “Turn these stones into loaves of bread” (Matt. 4:3).</p>

<p>After forty days, Our Lord must have been really hungry, as anyone would be. The devil picks Him out at His weakest moment, and that’s what he does to us also.</p>

<p>Now, the Lord answers him with a phrase from Scripture: “Man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds from the mouth of God” (Matt. 4:4; Deut. 8:3).</p>

<p>It’s a reminder that we are on this journey ourselves, and we also have to rely on the word of God.</p>

<p>Christ doesn’t reject or disclaim that He’s hungry, but He raises the matter to a higher level.</p>

<p>We could also remind ourselves that He is truly the Word of God and He is going to give us the Bread of Life, one of the means to overcome all temptation.</p>

<p>Christ gives us the means. He’s there with us at every moment; He doesn’t leave us alone with the devil. He’s going to give us that Eternal Bread.</p>

<p>The first temptation is a temptation to do things for our own advantage only: “turn these stones into bread.” Eat. The test is on the passions and the needs of the body. Temptation is to care only for the passing food and forget about the eternal Word.</p>

<p>“Do not labor for the food that perishes, but for that which endures to eternal life” (John 6:27). It’s a temptation to rely on one’s own strength, but happiness of life has an eternal dimension.</p>

<p>There are three stages of temptation. There’s suggestion, there’s complacency, and there’s consent. Mortal sin only exists at the level of consent.</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter how many suggestions we may have on a daily basis—to our purity, to our laziness, to our disorder, to our charity, to our obedience, our vanity, our pride, our selfishness—as long as we try not to consent to them.</p>

<p>All the most important people in sacred history have been tempted: Adam, Eve, Abraham, Moses, Peter, and Paul.</p>

<p>By rejecting the temptations of the devil, Our Lord atones for the faults of those who went before Him and those who will come after. His reaction is an example for all the temptations we may have, to greed, to gluttony, to avarice.</p>

<p>He later teaches in the <em>Our Father</em> to ask God to help us with His grace not to fall into temptation: “Lead us not into temptation” (Matt. 6:13).</p>

<p>Before beginning His work as Messiah, Our Lord prepares by prayer and fasting. That’s what the forty days of Lent are all about. The devil makes use of this opportunity. As we begin our mission, we shouldn’t be surprised that the devil has a go at us.</p>

<p>He’s physically empty. This makes Him vulnerable. He could work a miracle, but it’s not part of God’s plan. He prefers to trust in His Father.</p>

<p>We also learn from this how we have to be careful in moments of vulnerability—when we’re low, when we’re tired, when we’re discouraged.</p>

<p>The devil seems to say to Him: How can you be the Son of God and still be hungry? How can your loving heavenly Father have allowed you to be hungry? How can He love you and yet permit this contradiction?</p>

<p>The devil may say the same thing to us in modern parlance: How can you be poor and yet still loved by your heavenly Father? Or unsuccessful? Or unemployed? Or a failure? Or have cancer? Or be in this concentration camp or this jail?</p>

<p>Or your child is in jail or has this incurable disease, and God still loves you? How can you be condemned to die with an incurable sickness? Or how can you have failed your driving test and God still loves you?</p>

<p>A lady came to me once from another country and said, “Father, why is God so cruel? Why does he treat me so roughly? Why does he hate me so much?”</p>

<p>I was wondering what terrible thing had happened in her life. And she said, “I’ve just failed my driving test for the eighth time!”</p>

<p>All the contradictions of life does not mean that God does not love us. We believe with faith that Our Heavenly Father is looking after us 24/7. We have every reason to reject these subtle temptations.</p>

<p>When the devil is stripped of all his disguises, the ultimate goal of the satanic is to avoid the Cross. To avoid self-denial. Avoid standing on our pride, on our selfishness, on our egoism. Avoid any form of mortification.</p>

<p>To this temptation Christ said, “Get behind me, Satan!” (Matt. 16:23).</p>

<p>The three temptations of Christ were worldly ways of avoiding the Cross. At the beginning of His public life, the devil tries to show Christ another way of saving the world.</p>

<p>The way that Our Lord answers the devil teaches us how to deal with temptation. He also teaches us that we shouldn’t ask God for things that we can obtain with our own efforts. God wants us to use the human means.</p>

<p>And we shouldn’t just ask Him for what is exclusively for our own convenience, but rather what will help towards our holiness and that of others.</p>

<p>Jesus says: I can be poor and still be loved. I can be loved and still be hungry. I can be blessed and still be empty. I can be precious to God and still unfulfilled.</p>

<p>He invites us to look to the Word of God for our fulfillment. “Not in bread alone does man live, but on every word that proceeds from the mouth of God” (Matt. 4:4).</p>

<p>It’s an act of trust in Fatherly Providence. God will not let Him die. He led Him to the desert to prepare Him for His mission.</p>

<p>St. Gregory the Great says if we consider how Our Lord let Himself be treated in the Passion, it’s not surprising that He let Himself be treated by the devil as He did (<em>cf</em>. Gregory I, <em>Homilies on the Gospels</em>, Homily 16). It’s all a preparation for what’s to come.</p>

<p>“Then the devil took him into the holy city and set him upon the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, ‘If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down; for it is written: He has given his angels charge over you, and in their hands they will bear you up, lest you dash your foot against the stone.’ Jesus said to him, ‘It is written again: You shall not tempt the Lord your God’” (Matt. 4:5-7; Deut. 6:16).</p>

<p>In the second temptation, the devil realizes that he hasn’t won the first time. Now he asks Him to enlist the help of the angels: “He has given his angels charge over you.” The devil quotes Sacred Scripture. Interesting.</p>

<p>The test now is the ego—to show that if one is powerful enough, that He can overcome all.</p>

<p>Christ responds, also quoting Scripture, telling him not to test God.</p>

<p>Every time we think we’re powerful enough to overcome an occasion of sin that we put ourselves in, we are testing God: ‘I’m strong enough to resist the temptation.’ ‘I can watch this movie.’ ‘I can look at this picture.’ ‘I can answer this call.’ ‘I can meet this person.’</p>

<p>When we can only find out, to our cost to us, we’re not as strong as we thought we were.</p>

<p>The Church teaches us to flee from occasions of sin. “If your hand is an occasion of sin to you, cut it off” (<em>cf</em>. Matt. 5:30).</p>

<p>Christ is very radical. He doesn’t say take one long, last, lingering, loving look at your hand, and then kiss your hand goodbye, and make sure that your hand feels very good about it. Christ said, “Cut it off.”</p>

<p>We can ask Our Lord for the fortitude to cut the temptations, to distance ourselves from the occasions of sin, the subtle ways in which the devil comes to us.</p>

<p>When he says to us: Don’t worry, you’re strong; you’re a child of God; nothing will happen; so many of your friends have done the same; you’re a good Christian of proven virtue; surely there’s no sin in entertaining yourself—God is there to help us. By the way, in case you forget, He has even sent His angel.</p>

<p>We have an angel to take care of us. He needs to occupy himself a little bit with our care. The devil says let him do the necessary.</p>

<p>The devil says, “He will send his angel so that you don’t get hurt” (<em>cf</em>. Matt. 4:6). But over and above all this, Our Lord says, “You should not tempt the Lord your God” (Matt. 4:7; Deut. 6:16).</p>

<p>We can fly to the care of the angels for our help in moments of temptation. The <em>Prayer to St. Michael</em> is a prayer the Church recommends to say every day, particularly after Mass, and in all dangers and temptations.</p>

<p>Or the <em>Memorare</em> prayer to Our Lady when we feel things are getting hot. It’s a very good prayer to teach your children to make them aware of the devil, and to see how we shouldn’t be asking Our Lord for extraordinary help, when He wants us to avoid the occasions of sin ourselves—to see where the devil may be lurking, to see where the dangers are, to be clever. “The prudent of this world must be children of the light, not children of darkness” (Luke 16:8).</p>

<p>We know that God will help us when there’s no other way, but God is not a remedy for our laziness or our refusal to try.</p>

<p>The whole of Lent reminds us of the importance of struggle. The Old Testament says, “The life of man on earth is a struggle” (<em>cf</em>. Job 7:1). God wants us to struggle like He struggled on the way to Calvary. He fell down three times, but He got up again.</p>

<p>In this temptation the devil quotes Scripture. He sets himself up as an interpreter of Scripture. It’s a reminder to us to reject any interpretation of Scripture that is not in keeping with the teaching of the Church, stressing certain passages to the exclusion of others.</p>

<p>The Magisterium of the Church, guided by the Holy Spirit, is the one divine interpreter of Sacred Scripture. “All power in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go you, therefore, teach all nations” (Matt. 28:18-19). It’s the teaching power of the Church, guided by the Holy Spirit, that gives us the truth that is in Scripture.</p>

<p>The second temptation is temptation to the spectacular, the extraordinary. “Cast yourself down from the pinnacle of the temple.” Throw yourself out into the air. Do this publicity stunt. Anything to draw the crowd. Be like Superman, Batman, Spiderman.</p>

<p>The devil can also say that to us: Forget the ordinary. Be immersed in the extraordinary. Look for all sorts of extraordinary things.</p>

<p>But we know from Scripture that the ordinary passes unnoticed, like Jesus in Nazareth.</p>

<p>Some people may only believe in God and in Our Lady when they see spectacular things, miracles, apparitions, when they hear God speaking through the crowds, or when they see stigmata.</p>

<p>But Jesus bids us to look for the extraordinary in the ordinary.</p>

<p>The life of a Christian, when he has faith—when he works, when he rests, when he prays—in all moments, is always supernatural. It’s a life in which God is always present with reason enlightened by faith.</p>

<p>Our Lord rejects the [second] temptation as He did the first: “You shall not tempt the Lord your God.”</p>

<p>To tempt God is the opposite of trusting Him. We shouldn’t ask Him for extraordinary help, putting ourselves in dangerous situations: diving off some cliff into the ocean; driving when we’ve taken a drink or two; dilly-dallying with occasions of sin, with certain movies, or our phone, or people—things that we know are a danger for us.</p>

<p>We all have different temptations, different weaknesses. One man’s meat can be another man’s poison. We have to know what we have to be careful with.</p>

<p>And then there is the third temptation. “Again, the devil took him up a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them, and said to him, ‘All these will I give you, if falling down you will adore me.’ And Jesus said to him, ‘Be gone, Satan! For it is written: The Lord your God shall you adore, and him only shall you serve.’ Then the devil left him; and behold, angels came and ministered to him” (Matt. 4:8-11).</p>

<p>The third temptation is a temptation to possessions, to have power and glory. He “showed him all the kingdoms of the world.” It’s a temptation to have material things, to social status, to power—temptation to have plenty of dreams of how great it would be to possess the world, or at least half of it.</p>

<p>But the Lord seems to say that happiness does not come from material possessions. It comes from choosing God; at times, choosing the cross, following the pathway of our Christian vocation. Not from doing things that are easy.</p>

<p>We only get momentary happiness from possessions or some material thing. But that is passing and can leave us with a bitter sadness, like that of the rich young man who “went his way sad, because he had great possessions” (Matt. 19:16-22). He clung to his riches.</p>

<p>He could have been an apostle. He could have been one of the great instruments that Our Lord used to build His Church, but he did not want.</p>

<p>Our Lord invites us to let our dreams be on what is necessary to lead a decent life. “Do not labor for the food that perishes, but for that which endures to eternal life” (John 6:27). The rest is from the evil one.</p>

<p>Don’t just focus on desiring riches, or success, or money, or power, or glory. Don’t be like people who actually adore Satan in his many forms.</p>

<p>Sometimes the devil keeps his word. He gives them riches. He provokes Christ to take on the role of an earthly Messiah, a pseudo-Messiah: Identify yourself with the world. Do what is popular. Worship me for I am its prince.</p>

<p>St. Paul says, “Do not conform your mind to the ways of this world” (Rom. 12:2).</p>

<p>Christ invites us to be different—at times to clash with our environment, to stick our neck out. To be a leader. To be a conscientious objector, if necessary. To be different to everybody else.</p>

<p>There was a Dutch missionary priest in Singapore who used to tell newly baptized adults in his parish every year—there were sixty of them—“Now that you’re Catholics you have to be different. You can’t be the same as everybody else, because we’ve come to change this world. A Christian has to stand out.”</p>

<p>The devil says to the apostle: Don’t be unpopular. Don’t be different from your colleagues. Don’t clash with your environment. Take it easy.</p>

<p>It’s a temptation to reduce the God-given transcendental mission to a purely human and political one. It’s a reminder to the Church and to each one to remain faithful to its God-given mission in the world.</p>

<p>Fulton Sheen used to say, “Whoever marries the spirit of the world in this generation becomes a widow in the next” (Fulton J. Sheen, <em>Sermon</em>, September 22, 1940).</p>

<p>Our Lord replies: “Be gone, Satan! For it is written, the Lord your God you shall adore and him only shall you serve” (Matt. 4:10; Deut. 6:13). There’s an uncompromising rejection of an earthly messianism. Our Lord rejects all human glory.</p>

<p>We’re reminded too that although God had the right to be treated as a God, He took the form of a slave. “He emptied himself” (Phil. 2:7).</p>

<p>We can learn from the attitude of Jesus in these trials. The absence of earthly glory and the blessings of God are not incompatible. If we struggle constantly, we’ll attain victory.</p>

<p>We’re told that “the devil left him and behold, angels came and ministered to him.” Nobody is crowned without having first conquered. The coming of the angels teaches us the interior joy given by God to the person who fights energetically.</p>

<p>Our guardian angels are powerful defenders against temptations. Teach your children to invoke their guardian angel every day.</p>

<p>It is the temptation to identify fidelity to God with success in the eyes of the world. It’s difficult to believe that we’re special and loved by God even when we’re hungry or empty or unfulfilled; when we’re not successful in the eyes of the world.</p>

<p>“We’re not tempted because we’re evil, but because we’re human. There’s nothing intrinsically evil about human nature just because the devil knocks at the door. Evil begins when we open the door and consent to the temptation. Scripture praises the man who suffers temptations.” Job went through many temptations. “When we resist temptation, we strengthen our character” (Fulton J. Sheen, <em>Life Is Worth Living).</em></p>

<p>We need to be careful with temptations so that we don’t fall away from our ideals—the ideals of holiness, of our vocation, the ideals of our apostolate. We’ve come to change the world.</p>

<p>Sometimes we could thank Our Lord for the temptations that He permits in our life. Helps us to know our weaknesses, where we need to struggle.</p>

<p>Our Lord allowed Himself to be tempted, so we can’t be surprised if we’re tempted also.</p>

<p>St. Paul says to Timothy: “He is not crowned, except he who strives lawfully” (2 Tim. 2:5). “Blessed is the person who endures temptation, for when he has been proven, he will receive the crown of life” (James 1:12).</p>

<p>Tried in temptation, virtue grows and increases in firmness (<em>cf</em>. Leo I, <em>Sermon 39</em>).</p>

<p>We know that Our Lady “crushed the head of the serpent” (Gen. 3:15). In moments of temptation, we can turn to Our Mother and ask her for all the strength that we need, to ask her for the help to realize that every urge, every craving is not necessarily a worthy one.</p>

<p>The drug addict hungers for their next high, but we know that all drugs in that sense are bad for you. Saying no to temptation seems to go against the go-for-it philosophy that many people in society promote.</p>

<p>Even our body and mind seem to fight as we deprive it of the fuel it hungers for, regardless of whether that fuel is good or bad for our spiritual and emotional welfare.</p>

<p>Mary, help me to see where my weaknesses lie, and to be wise and prudent to use that information to my best advantage.</p>

<p>The good news is that the more we say no to temptation and ungodly desires, the more we actually strengthen those weak spots. God doesn’t want us to run and hide from temptation, but to face it head on so that we may clearly see the potential pit before us.</p>

<p>Mary, help us to confess our sins, to admit our weaknesses, and to ask God for the strength and the wisdom we need to stand against all evil.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>(Proofread)</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here. That you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My immaculate mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>After Jerusalem and Antioch, Rome was the most important early Christian nucleus. Many Christians came from the Jewish colony existing in Rome. The majority came over from paganism. Today we commemorate the Christians who underwent the first persecution against the church under the emperor Nero, after the destruction of Rome by fire.</p>

<p>The Christian faith had reached Rome very quickly, which was at that time the center of the civilized world. Perhaps the first Christians in the capital of the empire were converted Jews who had come across the faith in Jerusalem itself or in some cities of Asia Minor that had been evangelized by Saint Paul. The faith was passed on from friend to friend, between workmates and relatives. The arrival of Saint Peter in about the year 43 brought about a perceptible strengthening of the little Christian community that was there. From Rome, the new religion spread to many parts of the empire.</p>

<p>The internal peace enjoyed by the imperial world at that time, the improvements in communications that facilitated travel and the rapid transmission of ideas and news, all this favored the spreading of Christianity. The Roman roads that began in the city, the great city itself, reached the most remote corners of the empire. The commercial fleets that regularly crossed the waters of the Mediterranean all helped to spread the new Christian religion throughout the length and breadth of the Roman world.</p>

<p>It’s difficult to describe the process of conversion, the sequence of experience that affected each person who embraced Christianity in first century Rome, just as it is now. Because each conversion is always a miracle of grace and of personal correspondence with God’s gift of it.</p>

<p>There’s no doubt that a decisive influence was the good example given by the Christians. What Saint Paul calls the bonus odor Christi, the good odor of Christ, which had its repercussions in the way they worked, in their joy, their charity, and their understanding for everyone. In the austerity of their lives, and in their human likableness.</p>

<p>They were men and women who tried to live their faith fully in the midst of their ordinary activities. They were now to be found in all levels of society. Daniel was young and Joseph a slave. Aquila wrought a craft. The woman who sold purple dyestuffs supervised a busy workshop. Another was a prison governor. Another a centurion like Cornelius. Saint John Chrysostom says another was in ill health like Timothy. Another was a runaway from slavery like Onesimus. Nothing proved a hindrance to any of these, but all were joyously welcomed and accepted. Both men and women, both young and old, both slaves and free men, both soldiers and civilian citizens alike.</p>

<p>The Acts of the Apostles has left us a delightful account of the hospitality shown by the Christians in Rome. They tell of the welcome given to Paul when he was brought as a prisoner to the capital. The brethren there, Saint Luke informs us, “when they heard of this, came as far as the Forum of Appius and the Three Taverns to meet us. On seeing them, Paul thanked God and took courage” (Acts 28:15). Paul felt strengthened by these demonstrations of fraternal charity.</p>

<p>The first Christians did not give up their professional or social activities. Some people were to do so, with a specific call from God, rather more than two centuries later. With their lives and their words, they considered themselves very much part of this world. Of which they were convinced they were destined to be salt and light. An early Christian writer summed up saying Christians are to the world what the soul is to the body.</p>

<p>We can examine ourselves today to see whether like those first Christians, we too give a good example to the extent that we do in fact move others to come closer to Christ. Do we edify others by our sobriety? By the way we spend money? By our unquenchable cheerfulness? By doing our work well? By keeping our word? By the way we live justice at work with our subordinates and our peers? By carrying out works of mercy, and by never having a bad word to say about anybody at all?</p>

<p>The first Christians often came up against serious obstacles and misunderstandings, which in not a few cases led to their death for defending their faith in the Master. Today on this feast we celebrate the testimony of the first Roman martyrs. Their execution was the result of the burning of Rome in the year 64. This catastrophe provided the excuse for the first great persecution. To Saint Peter and Paul, whose feast we celebrated yesterday, were added a great number of chosen ones, “who having gone under many sufferings and torments out of envy, were the best models among us,” says Saint Clement of Rome. We read this in a vivid account to be found among the earliest Christian writings.</p>

<p>The obstacles and misunderstandings encountered by those who had been converted did not inevitably lead them to martyrdom. But they often experienced in their lives what the words of the Holy Spirit warn us in scripture. Indeed, says Saint Paul to Timothy, “All who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted” (2 Tim. 3:12). Sometimes the pagans’ antagonism to the followers of Christ arose because they could not bear the rich fruitfulness and splendor of devotion in the Christian daily life. At other times it arose because those who had received the faith had the duty of abstaining from the traditional religious ceremonial which was closely bound up with public life, and was even considered a test of loyalty, an open and formal proof of civic faithfulness to Rome and to the emperor.</p>

<p>Consequently, the pagans who embraced Christianity laid themselves open to misunderstandings and slanderous attacks for not conforming, for not being like the others. It’s unlikely that God will ask us to shed our blood in order to confess the Christian faith. Although if God were to allow such a trial we would ask him for the grace to enable us to give our lives in testimony of our love for him. We will however, in one way or another, meet all kinds of adversity. For being with Jesus means we shall most certainly come upon his cross.</p>

<p>“When we abandon ourselves into God’s hands, he frequently permits us to taste sorrow, loneliness, opposition, slander, defamation, ridicule, coming from both within and from outside the Church,” Saint Josemaría wrote in <em>Friends of God</em>. “This is because he wants to mold and form us into his own image and likeness. He even tolerates our being called lunatics and allows us, if we will, to be taken for fools. This is the way Jesus fashions the souls of those he loves. While at the same time never failing to give them inner calm and joy.”</p>

<p>Slander, perhaps seeing doors to promotion closed against us at work, friends or workmates who turn their backs on us, sarcastic remarks or derogatory words. If God allows them, we have to try and make use of such contradictions in order to live charity in a more heroic way. Precisely with those very people who do not have any respect for us. Perhaps out of inculpable ignorance. Our attitude can always include a just defense when necessary, especially when we have to avoid the possibility of scandal, or of injury being caused to third persons. Such situations will be a great help in enabling us to cleanse ourselves of our own sins and faults, to make reparation for those of others, to ask pardon for the offense that is made against God by them. And finally, to grow in virtue and in love of God.</p>

<p>God sometimes wants to purify us like gold in the crucible. Saint Jerome Emiliano said fire cleans gold from the dross, freeing it from impurities and greatly enhancing its value. God does the same with the good servant, who hopes and who remains constant in the midst of tribulation. If contradictions lie in our way and troubles beset us because we follow Jesus closely, we have then to be especially cheerful and give thanks to God. It makes us worthy to suffer something for him, as the apostles did. We’re told in the Acts of the Apostles, “Then they left the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the name” (Acts 5:41).</p>

<p>The apostles would doubtless have remembered the words of the Master, just as we meditate on them today during this feast of the first Roman martyrs. We are told in Saint Matthew, “Blessed are you when men revile you, and persecute you, and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for so men persecuted the prophets who went before you” (Matt. 5:11–12).</p>

<p>In spite of all ill-considered slander, infamy itself, and outbreaks of persecution, our first brothers in the faith did not fail to carry out an effective apostolate. They did not fail to tell people about Christ. The treasure they themselves had had the good fortune to find. Moreover, their calm and joyful bearing in the face of adversity, and even of death, was the very reason why many came to know the Master.</p>

<p>Tertullian says the deaths of the martyrs were the seeds of Christians. The Roman community itself, after so many men, women and children had given their lives in the course of that terrible persecution, went forward invigorated and strengthened. Years later, Tertullian wrote, “We are of but yesterday, and already we have filled the world and all your things. Cities, islands, towns, villages, hamlets, the army, the palace, the senate, the forum. We have left you only the temples.”</p>

<p>In our own sphere, in our present circumstances, if we perhaps encounter some slight difficulty to our remaining firm in the faith, we should understand that from this particular spot of bother will come a great good for all. It is at such times that we have most reason, and most need to speak with serenity about the wonder of the faith. About the immense gift of the sacraments. About the beauty of the fruits of living holy purity well. We should understand that we have elected to be on the winning side in the combat of this life, and also in that other glorious life that awaits us shortly.</p>

<p>Nothing compares with being close to Christ. Even if we had no possessions at all and had to suffer the painful illnesses of the most vile slander, so long as we possess Jesus, we possess everything. The effect of this realization should be noticeable even in our outward bearing, and in our awareness that we are at every moment, even in such circumstances, the salt of the earth and the light of the world, as the Master has told us. Referring to the philosophers of his day, Saint Justin rightly said that all the good spoken by them belongs to us Christians. Because after God, we adore and love the Word, who proceeds from the unbegotten and ineffable God himself. Indeed, for love of us he became man, so as to share in our sufferings and heal us.</p>

<p>In the opening prayer of the Mass today, we say, “Father you sanctified the church of Rome with the blood of its first martyrs. May we find strength in their courage and rejoice in their triumph.” This world of ours that we have to bring to you Jesus sometimes asks the apostles to listen attentively to his doctrine. At other times he calls them together so that he can be alone with them and explains a parable to them once again. Or shows them what lesson they should draw from something that has happened. He wants them to realize that they are being given a treasure, which is meant for the whole church, and of which later they will have to give an account.</p>

<p>“Take heed,” he says to them on one occasion. And he gives them the lesson. “To him who has will more be given, and from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away” (Mark 4:24–25). Saint John Chrysostom comments, to him who is diligent and fervent, will be given all the things that depend on God. But to him who has no love or fervor, and does not do what depends on him, what belongs to God will not be given him. For even what he thinks he has will be taken away. Not because God takes it away from him, but because he is incapable of receiving such graces.</p>

<p>“To him who has will more be given.” This is a basic teaching, says Saint Augustine, for the interior life of every Christian. To him who corresponds with grace, more grace will be given, so that he will have still more grace. But he who fails to make the inspirations, motions, and help of the Holy Spirit bear fruit will become even poorer. Those men who traded with their talents entrusted to them received a greater fortune or reward. But the man who hid his talent in the ground lost it.</p>

<p>Interior life, like love, is destined to grow. “If you say enough,” says Saint Augustine, “you are already dead.” Interior life always demands progress, correspondence, being ready to receive new graces. If you don’t go forward, you go backwards. God has promised that we will always have access to all the help we need at every moment. We’ll be able to say with the psalmist, “The Lord takes care for me” (Ps. 40:17). The difficulties, temptations, internal or external obstacles we come up against all cause us to grow. The greater the difficulty, the more the grace we receive.</p>

<p>If he permits us to experience great temptations or setbacks, he will give us proportionately still greater help to overcome them. Then all those things that seem to retard our struggle for holiness or even make succeeding in it seem impossible, will become the cause of spiritual progress and of our effectiveness in the apostolate. Saint Augustine says it’s only a lack of love, nothing less than lukewarmness, that causes the soul’s life to fall sick or die. Only a bad will, a lack of generosity towards God, can delay or prevent our union with him.</p>

<p>The vessel of faith carried to the fountain is filled according to its capacity. Christ is an inexhaustible source of help, of love, and of understanding. We can ask ourselves and examine ourselves with what capacity, with what longing do we approach him. Lord, we say to him in our prayer, make us thirst for you more and more, as the first Christians did. Make me thirst for you even more intensely than the man dying in the desert thirsts for water.</p>

<p>There are various reasons that can cause us to make scant progress in our interior life, and even to lose ground and give way to discouragement. But these reasons can be reduced to just a few. Carelessness, negligence in little things connected with service to God and friendship with him. Drawing back from the sacrifices that he asks of us. All we have to do, all we have to offer to God each day, are our little acts of faith and love. Petitions, acts of thanksgiving, thanksgiving after Mass, visit to the Blessed Sacrament and being aware that we’re going to meet Jesus Christ himself who is waiting for us. Our customary prayers throughout the day.</p>

<p>Human life is in some way a constant returning to the Father’s house. We return to our Father’s house by means of the sacrament of penance. In <em>Christ is Passing By</em>, we’re told God is waiting for us like the father in the parable, with open arms, even though we don’t deserve it. It doesn’t matter how great our debt is. Just like the prodigal son, all we have to do is open our heart, to be homesick for our Father’s house. To wonder at and rejoice in the gift which God makes us of being able to call ourselves his children, of really being his children, even though our response to him has been so poor.</p>

<p>God never abandons us. He always welcomes us, comforts us, and moves us to start again with more love, with more humility. Our weaknesses help us to seek for divine mercy and be humble. Growth in the virtue of humility means we’re able to make many steps forward in the interior life. All the virtues benefit from our being more humble. If at times we find we fail to correspond with all the graces we’ve received, if we have not been as faithful to God as he was expecting us to be, we must turn contritely to him with a contrite heart.</p>

<p>The Psalms say “Create a clean heart in me O God, and put a new and right spirit within me” (Ps. 51:10). We should often think of those things which, although they’re small, separate us from God. Then we will be moved to sorrow and contrition and be brought closer to him. In this way, our interior life emerges enriched, not only by our contending with exterior obstacles, but also by the recognition of our weakness, our mistakes, and our sins, drawing back from the sacrifices that he asks of us.</p>

<p>If we find it more difficult to begin again, our mother is always there to help us. She makes the way that leads to her son easier. We can ask her to help us with many acts of contrition. It’s interesting how the first Christians of Rome had great devotion to Our Lady, and in many streets of Rome you find a large image of Our Lady built into the building structure itself. We might find it helpful to repeat the prayer of the tax collector, “God be merciful to me a sinner” (Luke 18:13), or the prayer of King David, “A humble and contrite heart O Lord, you will not spurn” (Ps. 51:17).</p>

<p>Love grows within us and develops in the midst of our setbacks and the resistance each of us puts to that love on the inside. It also grows and develops in the face of resistance from the outside. That is, despite the many external forces that are foreign and even hostile to it. Our Lord has promised us that the help of his grace will never fail us. It all depends on our correspondence and our determination, and our willingness to start time and again without getting discouraged. The more faithful we are to grace, the more help he gives us, the easier we will find it to follow the way.</p>

<p>We’ll also find that more is being demanded of us and even greater finesse in our soul. Love always calls for more love. This interior life of ours is given a special chance to grow when we’re confronted with those adverse situations. For the soul, there is no obstacle greater than that which is created by our own wretchedness, and as a result of our carelessness and lack of love. But in those circumstances, says Saint Francis de Sales, the Holy Spirit teaches us and moves us to react in a supernatural way, with an act of contrition. God be merciful to me a sinner.</p>

<p>Saint Francis de Sales teaches us that we should feel ourselves strengthened by the silent saying of aspiratory prayers filled with love and sorrow, and desires for a deeper reconciliation, so that through them we may come to trust in his merciful heart. Acts of contrition are an effective means of spiritual progress. To ask for forgiveness is to love. It is to contemplate Christ the growing dispositions of understanding and mercy. As we are sinners, our way will be filled with acts of sorrow, of love that fill our soul with hope and renew our longing to set off again on the way to sanctity.</p>

<p>We need to return to Christ time and again without becoming discouraged or overworried. Although there may be many times when we have not responded well to love. God’s mercy is infinite and encourages us to start out again with a new determination, with renewed hope. We must be like the prodigal son. Instead of remaining far away in a foreign land, filled with shame and living in misery, he came to his senses and said “I will arise and go to my father” (Luke 15:18).</p>

<p>Let us ask Our Lord that our interior life would be nourished by the little things that we carry out with love and attention. Saint Josemaría wrote, to claim anything else would be to mistake our way. To find nothing or very little to offer to God. It’s good to remember how we find in <em>Christ is Passing By</em> the story of that character imagined by a French author, who set out to hunt lions in the corridors of his home. Naturally he didn’t find any. Our life is quite ordinary. Trying to serve God in big things would be like trying to hunt lions in the corridor. Just like the huntsman in the story, we would end up empty-handed.</p>

<p>Let us try to learn today from the example of the early Christians. We can ask Our Lady, our mother in the order of grace, mother of mercy and of forgiveness, to always enkindle in us the hope of attaining the ambitious target of becoming saints. May we place the fruits of these moments of personal prayer in your hands, with the conviction that if we correspond to grace, still more grace will be given to us.</p>

<p><em>I thank you my God for the good resolutions, affections, and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice. My immaculate mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel intercede for me.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

Conor Donnelly</p>

<p>(<em>Proofread</em>)</p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>Our Lord will always enlighten those who seek Him with a clean heart. To think about the life of St. Joseph is to discover a life full of joys and sorrows. Our Lord teaches us through the life of the Holy Patriarch that true happiness is never far from the Cross. If we bear suffering and trial with supernatural spirit, we will soon be rewarded with clarity and peace. With Christ at our side, sorrows turn into joys.</p>

<p>The Gospel relates the first sorrow and first joy of St. Joseph. We’re told, “When Mary his mother had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit” (Matt. 1:18).</p>

<p>Joseph was well aware of the holiness of his spouse, even though he could not understand the evident fact of her maternity. He was deeply perplexed. He loved Our Lady with a pure and deep human love. Yet he felt obliged by his upright conscience to follow the Mosaic Law in this regrettable situation.</p>

<p>In order to protect Mary from public shame, Joseph decided to put her away privately. This was a most painful test for both Joseph and Mary.</p>

<p>Just as his sorrow was great, so was Joseph’s joy immeasurable when at last he was shown the ways of God’s Providence. We’re told, “But while he thought on these things…” (Matt. 1:20).</p>

<p>These were the things that he could not hope to fathom, that he was unable to share with anyone. In the midst of this trial Joseph was visited by an angel, who said: “Do not be afraid, Joseph, son of David, to take to you Mary your wife, for that which is begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit” (<em>ibid</em>.).</p>

<p>All of Joseph’s doubts vanished at once. Everything had become clear. His soul had become filled with God’s peace. He now understood that he was the recipient of two incredible treasures, Jesus and Mary. He had been given for his wife the Mother of God. He had been given for a son the Son of God.</p>

<p>Joseph had become a different person. John Paul II says, “He became a unique guardian of the mystery ‘hidden for ages in God’ (Eph. 3:9)” (John Paul II, Apostolic Exhortation, <em>Redemptoris custos</em>, Point 5, August 15, 1989).</p>

<p>We can learn from Joseph’s first sorrow and joy that Our Lord will always enlighten those who seek Him with a clean heart. God’s light can shine through the most perplexing situations imaginable.</p>

<p>How often does it happen that we fail to grasp the meaning of God’s plans, the ‘why’ behind different circumstances and events. If we take care to trust in Our Lord, we will come to appreciate His divine wisdom. With that realization we will discover a deep sense of peace and joy in our soul.</p>

<p>A few months later, Joseph and Mary set off from Nazareth to Bethlehem to enroll in the census decreed by Caesar Augustus (<em>cf</em>. Luke 2:1). After this three or four-day journey, they were tired and worn out. This must have been especially true of Our Lady, a mother with child.</p>

<p>They had arrived at the town of their forefathers but they had no place to stay. There was no room for them at the inn. There was no home for them anywhere.</p>

<p>We can imagine Joseph going from door to door in search of shelter and hospitality for his pregnant wife. At each door he would have made the same simple request: ‘We have just arrived in town. My wife is about to deliver a child.’</p>

<p>Everywhere he must have received the same negative reply. Our Lady was probably close by on their donkey, a silent witness to this trying search.</p>

<p>What must this experience have been like for St. Joseph? What must have been his feelings at the sight of his weary wife, her clothing travel-stained, and every feature proclaiming her utter exhaustion?</p>

<p>Eventually they learned of some caves on the outskirts of the town. Joseph took Our Lady to one of those places which served as a stable. Our Lady could go no farther. “And it came to pass while they were there, that the days for her to be delivered were fulfilled. And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger” (Luke 2:6-7).</p>

<p>All of the anxiety and suffering that was there in that journey was quickly forgotten from the moment that Our Lady held the Son of God in her arms. St. Joseph would have realized that the Son of God was now his son as well. He would have kissed Him and worshipped Him.</p>

<p>In the midst of this simplicity and poverty, a multitude of the heavenly host appeared and proclaimed: “Glory to God in the highest” (Luke 2:14).</p>

<p>One writer says Our Lady experienced a great joy in these moments, and St. Joseph participated in her happiness. He contemplated the way she looked upon her Son, the way she spoke to Him, the way she watched over Him with loving reverence (<em>cf</em>. Federico Suarez, <em>Joseph of Nazareth</em>).</p>

<p>This alternating sorrow and joy should teach us that serving God is worth the effort, even though we will encounter difficulties, and perhaps poverty and pain. In the final analysis, a single look from Our Lady will more than make up for the little and not-so-little sufferings which may come our way.</p>

<p>We’re told in St. Luke, “When eight days were fulfilled for his circumcision, his name was called Jesus, the name given him by the angel before he was conceived in the womb” (Luke 2:21).</p>

<p>By means of this rite, each male was initiated into the community of the Chosen People. The ceremony took place either in the paternal home or in the local synagogue. The boy’s name was imposed at this time. The actual ceremony was sometimes performed by his father.</p>

<p>The giving of names had a special significance for the Jewish people. The name Jesus means <em>Savior</em>; it had been chosen by God Himself and communicated through the message of the angel: “You shall call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins” (Matt. 1:21).</p>

<p>It was the desire of the Holy Trinity that the Son should commence His salvific mission on earth in suffering. It would seem fitting that Joseph was the one to inaugurate the mystery of the Redemption by shedding the first drops of his Son’s holy blood.</p>

<p>One writer said this blood would yield its full effect in the awful context of the Passion (<em>cf</em>. Michel Gasnier, <em>Joseph the Silent</em>). The child who cried upon the receipt of His name had thereupon begun His work of salvation.</p>

<p>St. Joseph was himself pained at the sight of these first drops of blood. He was well versed in the Scriptures, and he knew, if only in an imperfect way, that there would come a day when his Son would have to shed His blood even to the last drop.</p>

<p>Joseph was filled with joy to carry the child in his arms and call Him Jesus, a name which countless people would later repeat with awe, with profound respect, and devotion. Joseph was always aware of the mystery involved in that name.</p>

<p>We’re told in St. Luke, “And when the days of her purification were fulfilled according to the Law of Moses, they took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord” (Luke 2:22). The Temple was to be the setting for the purification of Our Lady and the presentation of Our Lord, as prescribed by the Mosaic Law.</p>

<p>Upon their arrival at the Temple, the Holy Family were met by an elderly man called Simeon who was inspired by the Holy Spirit. Simeon took the child into his arms and with immense joy he praised God.</p>

<p>Simeon prophesied that this young child would become a “sign of contradiction” which many would obstinately reject. He foretold that Mary would be intimately united with the redemptive work of her Son. “A sword” would pass through her heart (<em>cf</em>. Luke 2:25-35).</p>

<p>This sword signifies a deep and lasting wound. Mary then understood the immensity of her Son’s sacrifice as well as the immensity of her own. The sorrow in this sacrifice was to be all the greater because some would reject as unwanted the graces won for them by her Son.</p>

<p>The prophecy of Simeon, one writer said, “the sword in the heart of Mary is also the sword in the heart of Joseph, since they were of one heart, <em>cor unum et anima una</em>, one heart and one soul. This sword represents the battle for or against Jesus. Mary is, therefore, directly tied…to the many diverse acts which constitute the history of mankind. It should be evident to us, however, that Joseph is also heavily involved in this struggle inasmuch as he was a loyal and loving husband” (Leon Cristiani, <em>St. Joseph, Patron of the Universal Church</em>).</p>

<p>When Joseph heard the prophecy of Simeon, surely a sword must have pierced his heart as well.</p>

<p>On that day in the Temple Joseph and Mary were given a more profound insight into the mystery of the Redemption which their Son would bring to completion. St. Joseph was now able to understand a little better the sorrow of his wife and Son. He made this suffering his own. He would probably never have forgotten the words that he heard in the Temple that morning.</p>

<p>Alongside the pain there must also have been the joy of impending universal redemption. Jesus was the salvation “prepared before the face of all peoples: a light of revelation to the Gentiles, and a glory for your people Israel” (Luke 2:31-32). No pain is greater than beholding a stubborn resistance to grace. No joy is comparable to understanding that the Redemption is being carried out in our time and that many souls are coming close to Christ.</p>

<p>We’ve all experienced the joy when a friend has returned to the sacrament of Penance, or when a friend has given his or her life to God without conditions.</p>

<p>One writer says: “O most holy and lovable Virgin! Help us to share in the sufferings of Jesus as you yourself did. Help us to have a profound horror of sin, an even greater desire for holiness, and a generous love for Jesus and his Cross. We would like to make reparation through our acts of love for your great sufferings and humiliations” (Adolphe Tanqueray, <em>The Divinization of Suffering</em>).</p>

<p>We can ask St. Joseph, our father and lord, to help us by his powerful intercession to bring Jesus to many people who live out their lives apart from Him.</p>

<p>St. Joseph was the custodian of Jesus and Mary, a father and spouse—foster father of Jesus and husband of Our Lady, the Mother of God. He was the person who was closest to Our Lord on earth after His Mother, the legal and practical father of Jesus.</p>

<p>The angel tells him to name the child Jesus; this was a right found only for fathers. He was the person who worked, suffered, and most cared for Jesus after Our Lady.</p>

<p>Our Lord must have been eternally grateful for all the things that he did for Him. He must have given him a great heaven. That’s why many fathers of the Church think that after Mary, he is the greatest. Together with Our Lord and Our Lady, he forms with them the Trinity on earth.</p>

<p>He must have taught Jesus, the Son of God, to work, to read, to write. He must have taught Him ways of speaking that must come out in the parables.</p>

<p>He was called in a special way to fulfill these two tasks: custodian of Jesus and Mary. In that vocation, all his other graces find their reason for being.</p>

<p>St. Jerome assigns some reasons for Mary’s espousal to Joseph: so that the ancestry of Mary be demonstrated by the genealogy of Joseph; so that she would not be stoned by the Jews as an adulteress; so that in her running away to Egypt she may have support; and the martyr Ignatius adds even a further reason: so that the birth of Christ may be hidden from the devil (<em>cf</em>. Jerome, <em>Against Helvidius</em>).</p>

<p>Joseph deemed himself unworthy of the Virgin Mother’s company. He trembled on beholding that she bore in her womb the Divinity Incarnate. He couldn’t fathom the mystery (Mary of Agreda, <em>The Mystical City of God</em>).</p>

<p>The angel tells us of the emotion of Joseph, which was fear (Matt. 1:20). In Scripture, the just men, when faced with divine mysteries, always express fear. If he suspected Mary of unfaithfulness, probably the emotion would not have been fear.</p>

<p>St. Josemaría loved St. Joseph so much that in his last years he used to say that his love grew in an impetuous manner (<em>cf</em>. Andrés Vázquez de Prada, <em>The Founder of Opus Dei</em>, Volume III). Each day that went by, he said that he loved him with a new impetus that was capable of overcoming all difficulties.</p>

<p>Why? Because God had reserved for St. Joseph the highest place that was possible to occupy after that of Our Lord and Our Lady.</p>

<p>God asked St. Joseph for something very big. Our Lady was the Mother of God, and he had the mission of covering up the miraculous maternity of his wife.</p>

<p>Jesus had to be a man like any other, so it was necessary for Joseph to be there. It was necessary for Joseph to participate in the game, you might say, in this divine game, and that he should be “a just man,” as Scripture says (Matt. 1:19)—a man who loved the will of God, and who always tried to put it into practice. The name of Joseph means “increase” (<em>cf</em>. Gen. 30:24).</p>

<p>For St. Joseph, the life of Jesus was a continuous discovery of his own vocation. As a light, the vocation is a maturing in the faith. It means growing in the life of grace. It doesn’t exclude all traces of obscurity, which are proper to the life of faith on earth. It fills one’s entire life.</p>

<p>For many people who approach God, it’s a light that sheds meaning on their lives. It’s a possibility that they discover in the depths of their being a light that gives meaning to their life so far and opens horizons for the future. By the light of faith, the person discovers God’s call to follow Him.</p>

<p>As an impulse, the vocation is a blossoming of charity, and therefore of freedom. God’s call and a person’s response mean the beginning of a transforming friendship (Hans Urs von Balthasar, <em>Vocation</em>).</p>

<p>St. Josemaría says, “St. Joseph, more than anyone else before or since, learned from Jesus to be alert to recognize the wonders of God, to have his mind and heart awake” (Josemaría Escrivá, <em>Christ Is Passing By</em>, Point 54).</p>

<p>We imitate St. Joseph by sanctifying our professional work. If our work is the work of a carpenter, then that’s the one we’re going to sanctify. If it’s that of an intellectual, man or woman, then that’s the one we’re going to sanctify. Which is more important, St. Josemaría would ask. The answer would be, “the one which is done with more love of God.” It is the love of God that gives divine importance to human things (<em>cf</em>. J. Escrivá, <em>Friends of God</em>, Point 55).</p>

<p>In that, St. Joseph gave us a great lesson. The call from God is a grace of Our Lord. A gift. A choice made by divine goodness.</p>

<p>Many young people change their lives when they decide to follow Our Lord. We can see them progress in their interior lives in a way that might previously have seemed unimaginable.</p>

<p>With faith come morals. By the light of faith, we can recognize in this change of life a sign of God’s call as He touches the soul and prepares it to fulfill the mission on which it is set out.</p>

<p>This is a lasting impulse, an interior grace which lasts a lifetime. St. Josemaría liked to say that perseverance in a vocation is the clearest sign of its divinity (<em>cf</em>. J. Escrivá, <em>The Way</em>, Point 983).</p>

<p>Vocation is a deep personal adherence that affects the whole person throughout their life. It grows with the person. Insofar as it is a free and irrevocable choice, it constantly helps one mature and produce the fruits of perseverance.</p>

<p>As a light and an impulse, the vocation exists at the level of theological faith. This means that even though it’s a special gift from God, and it’s important that it’s always perceived and presented in this way, recognizing it does not require extraordinary manifestations except in extraordinary circumstances.</p>

<p>St. Josemaría has said we cannot doubt that we have been deliberately chosen to be co-redeemers. Along with all the other reasons we have often considered, we have an external sign: the fact that we have been laboring so willingly in his work for no earthly gain.</p>

<p>In St. John, we’re told “The wind blows where it wills, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know whence it comes or whither it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit” (John 3:8).</p>

<p>Msgr. Fernando Ocáriz, Prelate of Opus Dei, has said, “While faith tells an individual that there is a general vocation to sanctity—communion with God in Jesus Christ—the existence of a special vocation for oneself is not the direct object of theological faith; it comes from natural knowledge of signs which, when seen in the light of grace of that special vocation, lead the mind to a moral certainty that one is being called.</p>

<p>“The fact that God (normally) does not impose a special vocation as an evident truth allows us to think that he wants the person’s freedom to come into play not only in the moment of answering the call, but in its shaping as well” (Pedro Rodriguez, Fernando Ocáriz, and Jose Luis Illanes, <em>Opus Dei in the Church</em>).</p>

<p>There are also some attitudes that are good to nurture in souls to equip them to recognize a call from God and give themselves: generosity, cheerful self-giving, and especially loving as Christ taught; awareness of the grandeur of being part of something greater than ourselves, that is, the beauty that surrounds the mystery of the Church and our participation in it.</p>

<p>In a climate of individualistic hedonism, these attitudes cannot always be taken for granted. In many cases, it’s an encounter with the mission for which one seems particularly suited, and with which one can identify with one’s own talents and aspirations, which sets the spark of vocational light in the soul. Each of the enormous varieties of different vocations found in the Church draws its specificity not from the level of holiness acquired—because one and all are called to holiness—but rather from the particular ecclesial mission that each one is invited to carry out.</p>

<p>This responsibility can then take focus in a thousand different ways. God’s call is doubtlessly the fullest response, as beautiful as it is demanding, to the aspirations born in a young heart.</p>

<p>In <em>The Forge</em>, St. Josemaría says “Committed! How I love that word!” (J. Escrivá, <em>The Forge</em>, Point 855). St. Joseph led a life of commitment. He obviously had a great love for his vocation. Each one of us should have a great love for our vocation. It is the best.</p>

<p>We can ask him to help us to foster a sincere desire for holiness, to desire that goal of our vocation. Sanctity is continuously doing what God wants, not what we want. We have to try and work at our vocation every day, to polish up that vocation, to keep the message of our vocation very clear on a day-to-day basis.</p>

<p>With all these things, we see a great example in St. Joseph. “How I love that word!” St. Josemaría says, “We children of God freely put ourselves under an obligation to live a life of dedication to God, striving that he may have complete and absolute sovereignty over our lives” (<em>ibid</em>.).</p>

<p>We can ask St. Joseph to help us to live out our vocation in the ways that God wants us each day of our life. From our meditation on his vocation, may we come to give ourselves in a greater way on a day-to-day basis.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

Conor Donnelly</p>

<p><em>(Proofread)</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins, and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful.</em></p>

<p><em>My Immaculate Mother, St. Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>St. John the Baptist is the only saint who is honored by the church on both the occasion of his birth and of his death.</p>

<p>Christ’s precursor teaches every one of us by his example of heroic fortitude to fulfill God’s will in our lives, no matter what the obstacles may be.</p>

<p>In the entrance antiphon of today’s mass, it says, “Lord, I shall expound your law before kings and not fear disgrace. I shall ponder your decrees which I have always loved” (Ps. 119:46–47).</p>

<p>The church celebrates the birth of John the Baptist on June 24th. Today she commemorates his <em>dies natalis</em>, the day of his final birth, the day of his death.</p>

<p>King Herod, as St. Mark calls him, ordered his execution.</p>

<p>Herod is one of the most pitiful individuals in the gospel. He ruled during Christ’s years of preaching and his manifestation as the awaited Messiah. He had even met the savior’s precursor.</p>

<p>“Behold the Lamb of God,” the Baptist told some of his disciples (John 1:36). Herod also used to enjoy hearing him speak.</p>

<p>He could have met Christ, whom he longed to see in person, but he committed the enormous injustice of beheading the one entrusted with the mission of pointing him out.</p>

<p>Immoral habits and evil passions led him to the awful crime. They also prevented him from perceiving the truth.</p>

<p>When he finally did meet Christ face to face, he blasphemously proposed the Lord of heaven and earth entertain him and his friends with a miracle.</p>

<p>St. John the Baptist preached what specific individuals needed to hear, given their particular circumstances in society. He spoke to common townspeople, publicans, soldiers, Pharisees, and Sadducees, and even to Herod himself.</p>

<p>Through his humble and austere example of integrity, he affirmed his testimony concerning the arrival of the Messiah.</p>

<p>The Baptist told Herod, “It’s not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife” (Mark 6:18).</p>

<p>He had no fear of the great and powerful, nor did he give importance to their threats. He bore in his heart God’s counsel to the prophet Jeremiah, which is recalled in the first reading of today’s Mass.</p>

<p>“Brace yourself for action, stand up and tell them all I command you. Do not be dismayed at their presence or in their presence I will make you dismayed.</p>

<p>“I, for my part, will make you into a fortified city, a pillar of iron, and a wall of bronze to confront the whole land.</p>

<p>The kings of Judah, its princes, its priests, and the country people will fight against you, but shall not overcome you, for I am with you to deliver you” (Jer. 1:17–19).</p>

<p>Our Lord asks for our fortitude in everyday things. He wants our exemplary life and our words to be a simple witness of our love for Christ and for his church, without ever giving in to fear or human respect.</p>

<p>St. Mark narrates how Herod had taken John and bound him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, whom he had married. She hated the Baptist because he had reproached the tetrarch for the notorious scandal of their illegitimate union.</p>

<p>She therefore sought to kill him.</p>

<p>But Herod liked to hear him speak, knowing that John was a just and holy man, and he feared and protected him.</p>

<p>Her opportunity arose when the king gave a banquet on his birthday and invited the foremost men of the region.</p>

<p>The daughter of Herodias danced in the sight of all and pleased Herod and his guests. The king swore to her, “Ask me for whatever you wish and I will give it to you, even though it be half my kingdom” (Mark 6:22–23).</p>

<p>Prompted by her mother, the girl demanded the head of John the Baptist.</p>

<p>Grieved as he was, the king was unwilling to displease her because of his oath and of his guests.</p>

<p>The disciples of the Baptist later took away his body and laid it in a tomb. Many of them would now become faithful followers of Christ.</p>

<p>John the Baptist was completely dedicated to Our Lord. He put all his energy into preparing Christ’s disciples for the master’s arrival, and in the end, he surrendered his very life.</p>

<p>St. Bede comments, there’s no doubt St. John suffered prison and chains as a forerunner of our Redeemer.</p>

<p>Though Herod did not demand that he deny Christ, he did try to oblige the Baptist to remain silent about the truth. We can therefore affirm that the precursor did suffer martyrdom.</p>

<p>Since death was ever near at hand through the inescapable necessity of nature, the martyr considered it a blessing to embrace it for acknowledging Christ’s name in return for the reward of eternal life.</p>

<p>St. Paul says of them, “You have been granted the privilege not only to believe in Christ but also to suffer for his sake” (Phil. 1:29).</p>

<p>St. Bede says he tells us why it is Christ’s gift that his chosen ones should suffer for him. “The sufferings of the present life are not worthy to be compared to the glory that is to be revealed in us” (Rom. 8:18).</p>

<p>Throughout the centuries, followers of Christ have rejoiced in suffering persecutions, tribulations, and unexpected difficulties for the faith.</p>

<p>Many have imitated the example of the apostles. After being lashed, they were enjoined not to speak in the name of Jesus and then released.</p>

<p>“They departed from the Sanhedrin, rejoicing over being deemed worthy to endure trial for the name of Christ.</p>

<p>Far from being intimidated, not for a single day did they cease teaching and preaching the good news of Jesus as the Christ” (Acts 5:41–42).</p>

<p>They must have recalled Our Lord’s counsel as recorded by St. Matthew. “Blessed are you when men reproach you and persecute you and speak falsely and say all manner of evil against you for my sake.</p>

<p>Rejoice and be glad, because your reward is great in heaven. For so did the men persecute the prophets who were before you” (Matt. 5:11–12).</p>

<p>We can make a resolution not to be disheartened or to complain if at some point in our life we have to suffer for being faithful to the call that we have received from Our Lord.</p>

<p>The history of the Church shows that all those who follow closely in the footsteps of Christ experience difficult moments and encounter the cross.</p>

<p>To ascend Calvary and co-redeem with Jesus, there are no easy and comfortable routes.</p>

<p>Even in the early Church, St. Peter writes a letter to all Christians imbued with consolation in the midst of suffering.</p>

<p>It wasn’t a matter of the bloody persecutions that would come later, but of the distressing circumstances many would experience for living in accordance with their faith.</p>

<p>For some, adversity would come through the family. Slaves had to put up with injustices from their masters, and women with the intolerance of their husbands. For others, calumnies, discrimination, or similar affronts arose.</p>

<p>St. Peter reminds the faithful that the difficulties they encounter are not meaningless. They should contribute towards one’s personal purification.</p>

<p>God’s judgment, not man’s, is what counts.</p>

<p>In imitation of Christ, we should keep in mind that during adversity, we can draw down many graces for our persecutors, including faith, as has so often occurred in the past.</p>

<p>He calls these individuals blessed and encourages them to bear their sufferings with joy.</p>

<p>He also invites them to consider that through baptism, the Christian is incorporated into Christ and participates in the Easter mystery.</p>

<p>In the midst of suffering, each one of us can share in the passion, death, and resurrection of Jesus, who gives fruition to our daily cross.</p>

<p>Since the time of St. John the Baptist, countless souls have given their lives in fidelity to Christ.</p>

<p>Jesus awakened enthusiasm among his followers. Immediate contact with him infused confidence. These benefits established a certain tone of living faith among the first Christians, which lent their lives solidity and strength.</p>

<p>These attributes are still preserved in the community of the faithful. Christianity has yielded rich and magnificent fruits since its inception.</p>

<p>Christ enjoys the testimony of a nearly 2,000-year history.</p>

<p>In spite of all external opposition and even hidden resistance, the faith has penetrated the inner recesses of hearts and has had an enormous impact on the world.</p>

<p>The Church today is a haven for every noble and sacred value.</p>

<p>One writer says it has passed the test of time that Gamaliel spoke of with astounding success. If it were a mere fabrication of men, it would have fallen into ruin long ago.</p>

<p>We can see the strength of faith and the love of Christ at work in ourselves and in millions who profess him, despite what at times seems overwhelming opposition.</p>

<p>Most likely, Our Lord will not ask for our bloody martyrdom as a witness to the faith. If he should, though, we would gladly correspond with that grace.</p>

<p>Our normal duties, rather, will be our constant cheerfulness in confronting a pagan environment, since calumny, sarcasm, or scorn may come our way.</p>

<p>Our joy will then abound on earth and will be doubled in heaven.</p>

<p>The Church wants to make us realize that the cross is always very close to Jesus and his followers.</p>

<p>As he struggles for perfect righteousness, sanctity in the world, the Christian will meet difficult situations and attacks by the enemies of God.</p>

<p>Our Lord has warned us, “If the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you. Remember the word that I said to you, a servant is not greater than his master. If they persecuted me, they will persecute you” (John 15:18, 20).</p>

<p>Since the very beginning of the Church, this prophecy has been fulfilled. In our days too, if we really follow Our Lord, we’re going to suffer difficulties and persecutions, in one way or another, and of different kinds.</p>

<p>St. Augustine says every age is an age of martyrdom. He said, don’t say that Christians are not suffering persecution. St. Paul says “All who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted” (2 Tim. 3:12). He says all, with no one being excluded or exempted.</p>

<p>St. Augustine says, if you want to test the truth of this saying, you’ve only to begin to lead a pious life and you’ll see what good reason he had for saying this.</p>

<p>At the very beginning of the Church, the first Christians in Jerusalem were persecuted by the Jewish authorities. The apostles were flogged for preaching Christ Jesus, and suffered it joyfully.</p>

<p>“They left the presence of the council rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the name of Jesus” (Acts 5:41), we’re told in the Acts.</p>

<p>The apostles must have remembered the words of Our Lord when he said, “Blessed are you when men revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account.</p>

<p>Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven. For so men persecuted the prophets who were before you” (Matt. 5:11–12).</p>

<p>St. John Chrysostom says, don’t say that they didn’t suffer, but that they rejoiced to suffer.</p>

<p>We can see that by the use to which they instantly put their freedom. Immediately after the flogging they gave themselves up to preaching with wonderful zeal.</p>

<p>When Paul came to Rome, Christians were already known by the unmistakable sign of the cross and of contradiction. With regard to this sect, say the Jews of Rome to Paul, “We know that everywhere it is spoken against” (Acts 28:22).</p>

<p>Our Lord, when he calls us or asks us for something, knows all about our limitations and the difficulties which we shall meet along the way.</p>

<p>When the time of difficulty arrives, Jesus will be at our side helping us with his grace. “In the world, you have tribulation, but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world” (John 16:33).</p>

<p>We shouldn’t be disconcerted if sometimes on our journey towards sanctity, we have to suffer some tribulation, trivial or serious, in a world with so many heathen characteristics.</p>

<p>We can then ask Our Lord for the grace to imitate St. John the Baptist in his courage, in his joy, in his zeal for proclaiming the truth of Christ, even in difficult circumstances.</p>

<p>Persecution can take many forms. During the first centuries, it tried to destroy the Christian faith by physical violence.</p>

<p>At other times, Christians have also been and are deprived of their most elementary rights.</p>

<p>Or attempts are made to confuse simple people by campaigns aimed at undermining their faith.</p>

<p>Even in countries with a great Christian tradition, every sort of obstacle and difficulty is put in the way of parents who wish to educate their children in a truly Christian way.</p>

<p>Or Christians, simply because they’re Christians, are denied a fair chance of advancing in their profession.</p>

<p>In societies which describe themselves as free, it’s not unusual for a Christian to have to live in an obviously hostile atmosphere.</p>

<p>Then there’s hidden persecution, by a sarcastic ridiculing of Christian values, or by pressure of opinion which tries to frighten the weaker brethren into conformity.</p>

<p>It adds up to a bloodless but severe persecution which often makes use of calumny and slander.</p>

<p>In former times, says St. Augustine, Christians were incited to renounce Christ, now they’re taught to deny Christ. Then they were forced, now they’re taught. Then violence was used, now it is deception. Then one heard the shouts of the enemy, now when he prowls around, gentle and insinuating, it’s difficult to recognize him.</p>

<p>Everyone knows how he tried to force Christians to deny Christ. He tried to attract them to himself so that they would renounce him. But they confessed Christ and were crowned by him.</p>

<p>St. Augustine says, now they are taught to deny Christ by trickery because he doesn’t want them to realize that he is drawing them away from Christ.</p>

<p>St. Augustine seems to be talking about our own times. Our Lord also wished to warn his followers not to be disconcerted when they were misjudged, not by the heathen, but by their own brothers in the faith, who usually because of envy, stereotyped reactions, or lack of rectitude of intention, would think that they were offering a service to God by this unjust behavior.</p>

<p>All contradictions, but especially these last, must be endured in the company of Our Lord in the tabernacle.</p>

<p>There, the apostolate in which we’re working will acquire a special fruitfulness.</p>

<p>Circumstances like these mean that Our Lord is calling us in a special way to be united with him through prayer.</p>

<p>There are times when we have to dispel misunderstandings, but always with courage and patience, without ever returning evil for evil.</p>

<p>What’s more, our interior life has need of contradictions and obstacles in order to grow strong and consistent.</p>

<p>With the help of Our Lord, the soul comes out of these trials purified and more humble. We can take the joy of Our Lord in a special way and can say with St. Paul, “I am filled with comfort, with all our affliction, I am overjoyed” (2 Cor. 7:4).</p>

<p>In the opening prayer of today’s mass it says, Lord, grant us the grace to imitate your martyr, who prayed for his executioners, so that we may learn to love our enemies.</p>

<p>A Christian who’s persecuted for following Jesus will draw from this experience a great capacity for understanding other people and a firm resolution never to wound them, never to offend them, never to treat them badly.</p>

<p>Our Lord asks us also to pray for those who persecute us, “speaking the truth in love” (Eph. 4:15).</p>

<p>These words of St. Paul show us how to teach the doctrine of the gospel without losing the charity of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>The last beatitude finishes with a fervent promise from Our Lord. “Blessed are you when men revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven” (Matt. 5:11–12).</p>

<p>Our Lord is always a generous paymaster. We too have been called to spread Christ’s truth without fear or concealment, being inspired by John the Baptist who died for proclaiming the truth.</p>

<p>We’re told in St. Matthew, “Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul” (Matt. 10:28). The immortality of the soul is one of the most powerful truths of our faith.</p>

<p>Because of this, when it’s a question of proclaiming Christ’s saving doctrine, we can’t give in when we come up against obstacles. We must follow the saying of St. Josemaría in <em>The Way</em>, who says, “Don’t be afraid of the truth, even though the truth might mean your death.”</p>

<p>The day on which Christians are persecuted, slandered, or ill-treated for being disciples of Jesus Christ, is for them a day of victory and profit. “Your reward is great in heaven” (Matt. 5:12).</p>

<p>Even in this life, Our Lord pays with interest. But it’s in the next we can hope, if we are faithful, for an enormous reward. Here, joy can never be perfect. But when we come close to Our Lord through prayer and the sacraments, we enjoy a foretaste of eternal happiness.</p>

<p>St. Paul wrote to the Romans, “I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us” (Rom. 8:18).</p>

<p>The history of the Church shows that at times tribulation makes someone grow cowardly and cold in his relationship with God. At other times in the country, it ripens sanctity and souls who take up the cross of every day and follow Christ, becoming identified with him.</p>

<p>We always see this double possibility. The same difficulty, illness, misunderstandings, has different effects according to the dispositions of the soul.</p>

<p>If we want to be saints, it’s obvious that our disposition has to be that of always following Our Lord closely, in spite of the difficulties. At times of setback, it’s helpful to foster the hope of heaven. It will help us to be firm in our faith, when we’re faced with any kind of persecution or attempts to confuse us.</p>

<p>St. Teresa of Avila says, “If you always pursue this determination to die rather than to fail to reach the end of the road, the Lord may bring you through this life with a certain degree of thirst, but in the life which never ends, he will give you great abundance to drink, and you will have no fear of its failing you.”</p>

<p>Our joy will then abound on earth and be doubled in heaven. St. Josemaría says we need always to see problems in a positive light. Let obstacles only make them bigger. The grace of Our Lord will not be lacking.</p>

<p>We’re told in the psalms, “Through the very midst of the mountains the waters will pass” (cf. Ps. 104:10). You will pass through the mountains.</p>

<p>But we need faith, a keen and living faith, a faith like Peter’s. When you have it, Our Lord has said so, we will move mountains, humanly insuperable obstacles that rise up against our apostolic undertakings.</p>

<p>Moreover, God’s consolation will never be lacking. If at some point following the path of Jesus is more trying, as it was for St. John the Baptist, we can seek refuge in Our Lady, the help of Christians. She will provide us with protection and shelter us with her cloak.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice.

<p><em>(Proofread)</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here. That you see me, and that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins, and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>Devotion to the Sacred Heart already existed in the Middle Ages as a private devotion. It appears as a liturgical feast in 1675, following the apparitions of Our Lord to Saint Margaret Mary Alacoque. In these revelations, the saint was given to know with special depth the need to make reparation for her personal sins and for the sins of the whole world, and to respond to Christ’s love.</p>

<p>Our Lord asked her to extend the practice of frequent Communion, especially on the first Friday of every month, in a spirit of reparation. He asked for the first Friday after the octave of Corpus Christi to be dedicated as a special feast to glorify His heart.</p>

<p>The feast was celebrated for the first time on the 21st of June, 1686. Pius IX extended it to the whole Church. In 1928, Pius XI gave it the splendor that it has today.</p>

<p>Beneath the symbol of the human heart of Jesus, we consider above all the infinite love of Christ for each individual soul. This is why devotion to the Sacred Heart stems from the principles of Christian doctrine, as Pope John Paul II has made clear in his abundant teaching about this consoling mystery.</p>

<p>In the entrance antiphon, we’re told that the designs of His heart shall endure from age to age, to rescue our souls from death and nourish us in our hunger.</p>

<p>There’s a twofold aspect to the solemnity that we celebrate today. On the one hand, there is thanksgiving for the wonder of God’s love for us. On the other, there is reparation. Because this love is often poorly responded to, or scarcely repaid. Even by those who have so many reasons for loving and thanking God.</p>

<p>The basis of Christian piety has always been the consideration of Christ’s love for all men. This is why devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus stems from the principles of Christian doctrine, says Pope Pius XII.</p>

<p>This devotion received a special impulse from the devotion and piety of many saints to whom Our Lord disclosed the secrets of His most loving heart, moving them to spread devotion to the Sacred Heart and to foster a spirit of reparation.</p>

<p>On the Friday after the octave of the feast of Corpus Christi, Our Lord asked Saint Margaret Mary to promote love for frequent Communion, especially on the first Friday of every month, in a spirit of reparation. He promised that He would let her share each Thursday to Friday night in His suffering in the Garden of Olives.</p>

<p>One year later, Our Lord appeared to her, laying bare His most Sacred Heart. He spoke to her in words that have nourished the piety of many souls. He said, “See this Heart that has loved men so much and has spared itself nothing, until it has exhausted itself and consumed itself in order to show them its love. I receive in return scarcely anything but ingratitude because of their irreverence and sacrileges, and because of the coldness and disdain they show towards Me in this Sacrament of Love.”</p>

<p>“But what hurts me still more is that it is hearts who are consecrated to Me who treat Me in this way. This is why I ask you that on the first Friday after the octave of Corpus Christi, a special feast may be dedicated to the honor of My heart, by receiving Communion on that day and making reparation with some act of atonement.”</p>

<p>Pope Saint John Paul II has said that in many parts of the Church, there exists the private custom of making reparation on the first Friday of the month with some Eucharistic act or by saying the Litany of the Sacred Heart. Moreover, the month of June is dedicated in a special way to the veneration of the Divine Heart. Not just on one day, the liturgical feast which generally falls in June, but every day.</p>

<p>The heart of Jesus is the source and expression of His infinite love for each person, whatever the person’s situation may be. Our Lord seeks out each one of us.</p>

<p>A beautiful text taken from the prophet Ezekiel says, “I am going to look after my flock myself, and keep all of it in view. As a shepherd keeps all his flock in sight when he stands up in the middle of his scattered sheep, so shall I keep my sheep in view. I shall rescue them from wherever they may have been scattered during the mist and darkness” (Ezek. 34:11–12).</p>

<p>Each person is an individual whom the Father has entrusted to the Son, so that he or she shall not perish, even though they may have strayed far away.</p>

<p>Jesus, true God and true man, loves the world with a human heart, says the Second Vatican Council. A heart that serves as a channel for God’s infinite love. Nobody has ever loved more than Jesus does. Nobody ever will love us more.</p>

<p>Saint Paul said to the Galatians, “He loved me and gave himself up for me” (Gal. 2:20). Each one of us can repeat those words. His heart is full of the Father’s love, full in a way that is at once both divine and human.</p>

<p>Christ’s heart loved as no other heart has ever loved. He experienced sadness and joy, compassion and sorrow. The Evangelists frequently tell us of the feelings of Jesus. As in Saint Mark where he says, “I have compassion on the crowd” (Mark 8:2). He had compassion on them because they were like sheep without a shepherd.</p>

<p>The successful outcome of His apostles’ first venture into evangelization made Him feel as we do when we receive some good news. Saint Luke says, “He rejoiced” (Luke 10:21). In Saint John, He weeps when death takes His friend from Him. Neither does Our Lord hide His disappointment—“Jerusalem, Jerusalem, killing the prophets. How often I would have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood, but you did not want to” (Matt. 23:37). How often.</p>

<p>Jesus sees the whole history of the Old Testament and of mankind, a portion of the Jewish people and of the Gentiles of all times, who will reject God’s love and mercy. We can say that in this passage, God is somehow weeping with human eyes for the sorrow He feels in His human heart. This is the real meaning of devotion to the Sacred Heart, to translate God’s nature into human terms for ourselves. It’s not a matter of indifference to Jesus, any less than is our daily relationship with Him at the present time. That some lepers fail to return to thank Him, after they had been cured.</p>

<p>He’s not indifferent to the hospitality and consideration shown towards a guest, as He told Simon the Pharisee. On many occasions, He experienced the great joy of seeing someone repent of his sins and become His disciple. Or also of seeing the generosity of those who left everything to follow Him.</p>

<p>He was affected by the joy of blind men who are able to see perhaps for the first time in their lives. Before celebrating the Last Supper, He was already thinking that He would remain with us forever by means of the Blessed Eucharist that He was about to institute. “I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer” (Luke 22:15).</p>

<p>This emotion must have been even stronger when He took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to His disciples, saying, “This is My body” (Luke 22:19). Who shall ever be able to express the feelings in His most loving heart, as He gave His mother to us on Calvary to be our mother?</p>

<p>When He had already surrendered His life to His Father, one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and at once there came out blood and water (cf. John 19:34). This open wound reminds us today of the immense love that Jesus has for us. Because He willingly gave the very last drop of His precious blood for us. As though each of us were alone in the world.</p>

<p>Are we not then going to approach Christ with confidence? What amount of wretchedness can prevent our loving Him, so long as our heart is big enough to ask for forgiveness?</p>

<p>After He had ascended into Heaven in His glorified body, Christ did not cease to love us. He doesn’t stop calling us now, to live always close to His most loving heart. Even in the glory of Heaven, in His hands and feet and side, He bears glowing marks of the wounds which represent the triple victory gained by Him over the devil, sin, and death.</p>

<p>Pius XII says He likewise has in His heart, placed as it were in a most precious shrine, those treasures of merit, the fruits of His triple triumph. These He bestows generously on redeemed mankind.</p>

<p>Today, on this solemnity, we adore the most Sacred Heart of Jesus. Since that heart of His participates in and is the natural and most expressive symbol of the inexhaustible love with which our divine Redeemer still loves mankind. That heart indeed, although it is no longer liable to the disturbances of this mortal life, still lives and beats. It is now inseparably joined with the Person of the Divine Word, and in it and through it with His divine will.</p>

<p>Wherefore, says Pope Pius XII, since the heart of Christ overflows with divine and human love, and since it is abundantly rich with the treasures of all the graces our Redeemer acquired by His life, His sufferings, and His death, it is truly the unfailing fountain of that love which His Spirit pours forth into all the members of His mystical body.</p>

<p>As we meditate today on the love that Christ has for us, we will feel a desire to thank Him for such a great gift and for so much unmerited mercy. As we consider how so very many turn their backs on God, let us remember that often we ourselves are not altogether faithful. That we have many personal weaknesses.</p>

<p>We should turn then to His most loving heart, where we shall find peace. We often need to have recourse to His merciful love, and to seek that peace which is one of the fruits given us by the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>We can say that aspiration Saint Josemar’a liked so much: “Cor Iesu Sacratissimum et Misericors, dona nobis pacem.” Most sweet and merciful heart of Jesus, grant us peace. As we see Jesus so close to our concerns, to our problems, to our ideals, we can say to Him in the words of the <em>Furrow</em>: “I give you thanks, my Jesus, for your decision to become perfect man, with a heart which loves and is most lovable. Which loved unto death and suffered. Which was filled with joy and sorrow. Which delighted in the things of men, and showed us the way to Heaven. Which subjected itself heroically to duty, and acted with mercy. Which watched over the poor and the rich, and cared for the sinner and the just alike. I give you thanks, my Jesus. Give us hearts that will measure up to yours.”</p>

<p>We are told in Saint John that after Jesus had taken the wine, He said, “It is fulfilled” (John 19:30), and bowing His head, He gave up His spirit. We are reminded that joy is compatible with mortification and pain.</p>

<p>Chesterton said that of all the accounts that are given of Jesus on the cross, one that is missing is the account of the joy of Jesus on the cross, in the fact that it is accomplished.</p>

<p>The prophet Isaiah says, “Rejoice with Jerusalem and be glad for her, all you who love her” (Isa. 66:10). Joy is essentially a Christian characteristic. The Church does not fail to remind us that it should be present at every moment of our lives. As we look at the Sacred Heart of Jesus, we can be reminded that that’s the place for us to find our joys.</p>

<p>All people with broken hearts can find solace in the broken heart of Christ on the cross. Fulton Sheen liked to say that when God allows hearts to be broken, it’s because He wants to enter into them a little more. But you just have to give Him all the pieces.</p>

<p>We get a profound joy of being united to Christ. Only in Him can each of us say with Saint Paul, “He loved me and gave Himself up for me” (Gal. 2:20). John Paul II said this should be the source of our greatest happiness, as well as the source of our strength and support, should we have the misfortune to encounter sorrow, undergo suffering, experience misunderstanding, or even to fall into sin.</p>

<p>We can always turn to the one who always loves us. With His infinite love as God, He overcomes every trial, fills our emptiness, forgives all our sins, and eagerly impels us toward a new path that is safe and joyful. The Church wants to remind us that joy is perfectly compatible with mortification and pain.</p>

<p>It is sadness and not penance which is opposed to happiness. The Church can be filled with joy, and each one of us. “Rejoice with Jerusalem,” we’re told, “and be glad for her, all you who love her” (Isa. 66:10). The mortifications that we do do not cast a shadow over our interior joy. We can feel very closely united to Our Lord, so that our lives may reflect once more the suffering that He underwent for our sakes. As well as experiencing great happiness in the attainment of the glory and joy of the resurrection through His passion and cross.</p>

<p>Joy has a spiritual origin, arising from a heart that loves and feels itself loved by God. Saint Paul says to the Philippians, “Rejoice in the Lord always, again I say, rejoice” (Phil. 4:4). This with a cheerfulness that is real happiness. An interior joy which cannot fail to be shown outwardly as well.</p>

<p>Saint Paul VI says it is well known that there are different degrees of this joy. Its most noble expression is the cheerfulness or happiness in its strict sense. When someone at the level of his higher faculties finds satisfaction in the possession of a good which is recognized and loved. All the more reason then that such a one should experience spiritual joy and happiness when his spirit enters into the possession of God who is known and loved as his supreme and immutable good.</p>

<p>Saint Paul VI goes on to say, “Technological society has succeeded in multiplying the occasions of pleasure, but finds great difficulty in giving birth to happiness. For happiness has its origins elsewhere, it is a spiritual thing. Money, comfort, hygiene, material security may often not be lacking, but nevertheless, despite these advantages, boredom, suffering and sadness are frequently to be found supervening in the lives of many people.”</p>

<p>Christians understand these thoughts of the Pope very well. They’re aware that joy and happiness stem from a heart that knows itself to be loved by God, and which in its turn is madly in love with Him. It will be a heart that strives to express its love in deeds. Since it knows that deeds are love, not sweet words. It knows itself to be that of a sinner, so it goes to the source of all forgiveness, to Christ in the sacrament of penance.</p>

<p>When we go to confession, we could think particularly of how the Sacred Heart of Jesus is reaching out to us. Something flowing from His heart into our heart to wash away our sins. Saint Paul says, “Lord, it is with great joy that we offer You the sacrifice that brings everlasting healing.”</p>

<p>Suffering and tribulation are inevitably the lot of everyone on this earth. Everybody needs the consolation coming from the heart of Christ. But suffering of itself alone neither transforms nor purifies. It may even be the cause of rebellion and hatred. Some Christians abandon Our Lord when they meet the cross, because they seek a purely human happiness, free from pain, and accompanied by material wealth.</p>

<p>Our soul will then be more purified, our love stronger. We will realize that joy is inseparable from the cross. It can be useful to remember that Saint Paul’s life was in no way easy or comfortable. Five times he said, “I have received at the hands of the Jews the forty lashes less one. Three times I have been beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three times I have been shipwrecked. A night and a day I have been adrift at sea. On frequent journeys, in danger from rivers, danger from robbers, danger from my own people, danger from Gentiles, danger in the city, danger in the wilderness, danger at sea, danger from false brethren. In toil and hardship, through many a sleepless night, in hunger and thirst, often without food, in cold and exposure” (2 Cor. 11:24–27).</p>

<p>Still, in spite of all this, Saint Paul speaks the truth when he tells us, “I am filled with comfort, with all our affliction I am overjoyed” (2 Cor. 7:4). Saint Josemar’a comments: “If at times we’ve been afraid of penance and atonement, we will be filled with courage at the thought of how short is the time involved, and how great the reward. A prize entirely disproportionate to our own little efforts. Let us cheerfully follow Jesus to Jerusalem, to Calvary, to the cross.”</p>

<p>After all, is it not true that as soon as you cease to be afraid of the cross, of what people call the cross, when you set your will to accept the will of God, then you find happiness, and all your worries, all your sufferings, physical or moral, pass away? During the Mass of this solemnity, we pray: “Father, we rejoice in the gifts of love we have received from the heart of Jesus your Son. Open our hearts to share His life, and continue to bless us with His love.”</p>

<p>We can draw from these moments of prayer the immense joy of considering once again the deep love that Jesus has at this moment for each one of us. A God with a heart of flesh like ours. Jesus of Nazareth still goes about the streets and squares of our cities doing good, just as when He was clothed in mortal flesh among men, helping, healing, consoling, forgiving, and through His sacraments conferring eternal life on us.</p>

<p>Saint Josemar’a says these are the infinite treasures of His heart, which He continues to pour out copiously upon us. Saint Paul teaches that “when He ascended on high, He led a host of captives, and He gave gifts to men” (Eph. 4:8). Every day we receive immeasurable graces, inspirations, and all types of material and spiritual help from the loving heart of Jesus.</p>

<p>However, He does not lord it over us. He begs us to give Him a little love, as He silently shows us His wounds. There may have been times when we have refused Him that love. Maybe often He has hoped that we would show more love, greater fervor, as we make that visit to the Blessed Sacrament or receive Holy Communion.</p>

<p>We need to make a great deal of reparation and atonement to the most Sacred Heart of Jesus for our past life, for so much wasted time, for so much roughness in the way we have dealt with Him, for so much lack of love.</p>

<p>We can say to Him in the words written by Saint Bernard: “I beg you to receive the offering of the years remaining to me. Do not despise, O my God, this heart which is contrite and humble because of all the years that I’ve spent so foolishly. Give me, Lord, the gift of contrition, despite being so clumsy in the way I talk to you and show my love for you. Increase my aversion for my deliberate venial sin. Teach me to offer you in expiation all the physical and moral setbacks of each day, my tiredness at work, and my efforts to finish off my daily tasks the way you would like me to.”</p>

<p>When we see so many people who seem set on fleeing from grace, we can’t remain indifferent. Don’t be content, says Saint Josemar’a, in the way you ask Jesus for pardon for just your own faults. Don’t love Him with your heart alone. Console Him for every offense that has been, that is, or that will be done Him. Love Him with all the strength of all the hearts of all those who have most loved Him. Be daring, telling Him that you are crazier about Him than Mary Magdalene, and either of his two Teresas. That you love Him madly, more than Augustine and Dominic and Francis, more than Ignatius and Xavier.</p>

<p>As always, we go to Jesus through the Immaculate Heart of Mary, asking her to take us little children by the hand, to lead that life of atonement and companionship with Jesus.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice. My immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

Conor Donnelly</p>

<p>(<em>Proofread</em>)</p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>“‘How can you sleep?’ he asked. ‘Rise up and pray, so that you may not enter into temptation’” (Luke 22:46).</p>

<p>There are many passages in the Gospel speaking about how Our Lord had withdrawn from the crowds and gone on His own to pray (Matt. 14:23; Mark 1:35; Luke 5:16, etc.).</p>

<p>And that’s more clearly thrown into relief at the more important moments of His public ministry: at His Baptism (Luke 3:21-22); at the election of the apostles (Luke 6:12-15); on the occasion of the first multiplication of the loaves (Mark 6:46); at the Transfiguration (Luke 9:28-29). It was a normal thing for Jesus to do.</p>

<p>St. Josemaría says, “At times he spent the whole night in an intimate conversation with his Father. The apostles were filled with love when they saw Christ pray” (Josemaría Escrivá, <em>Christ Is Passing By</em>, Point 119).</p>

<p>Before giving Himself in the Passion, Our Lord makes for the Garden of Gethsemane with His apostles. Our Lord must often have prayed there, because, St. Luke says, “Now he went out, as his custom was, to Mount Olivet (Luke 22:39).</p>

<p>But this time His prayer would be special because the moment of His agony had arrived.</p>

<p>When He comes to Gethsemane, He says to them: “Pray that you may not enter into temptation” (Luke 22:40). Before withdrawing a little to pray, Our Lord asked the Apostles too to pray.</p>

<p>He knows that they soon would be subjected to the temptation of scandal on seeing the Master taken captive. He had already announced it at the Last Supper; but now He warns them that unless they’re found vigilant and praying, they will not pass the test.</p>

<p>Prayer is indispensable for us, for if we neglect our dealings with God, little by little our spiritual life begins to languish.</p>

<p>In the <em>Furrow</em> we’re told, “If you abandon prayer you may at first live on spiritual reserves…and after that, by cheating” (J. Escrivá, <em>Furrow</em>, Point 445).</p>

<p>Bishop Sheen likes to say, “No one ever fell away from God without neglecting their prayer” (Fulton J. Sheen, <em>Characters of the Passion: Lessons on Faith and Trust</em>).</p>

<p>On the other hand, prayer unites us to God. He tells us, “Without me, you can do nothing” (John 15:5).</p>

<p>It is good, said St. Luke, to pray with perseverance, never vacillating (<em>cf</em>. Luke 18:1).</p>

<p>We have to speak with Him a great deal, insistently, in the various circumstances of our lives.</p>

<p>Now, moreover, we walk with Jesus along the Way of the Cross. In <em>The Way,</em> Point 89, we’re told, “without prayer, how difficult it is to accompany him.”</p>

<p>With the example of His own life, the Lord teaches us what our fundamental approach has to be: a continuous filial dialogue with God.</p>

<p>St. Teresa of Ávila has said, “In my view, mental prayer is nothing more but friendly dialogue and frequent solitary conversation with him whom we know loves us” (Teresa of Ávila, <em>Life</em>).</p>

<p>We have to try always to be in the presence of God and to contemplate the mysteries of our faith. This dialogue with God should not be interrupted, and even further, should be carried out in the midst of all our activities.</p>

<p>There are certain periods of the liturgical year when it should be even more intense; in a period of the day, even more intense, during mental prayer: we meditate, we speak in His presence, knowing that He truly sees us and hears us—“that you see me, that you hear me” (<em>Prayer Before Meditation</em>).</p>

<p>The need for prayer, together with the importance of charity, is one of the points most stressed by Our Lord in His public ministry.</p>

<p>“Then he parted from them, and going a stone’s throw-off, he knelt down to pray. ‘Father,’ he said, ‘if it pleases you, take this chalice from before me; only as your will is, not as mine is’” (Luke 22:41-42).</p>

<p>When His spiritual suffering was so intense that it led Him to agony, Our Lord turns to His Father with a prayer brimming with confidence.</p>

<p>He calls Him <em>Abba</em>, “Father,” and says intimate things to Him (Mark 14:36). This is the way that we also should adopt.</p>

<p>In our lives there will be moments of spiritual peace and others of more intense struggle, some moments perhaps of darkness and others of profound sorrow, with temptations to discouragement.</p>

<p>But the sight of Jesus in the Garden always points to the way that we have to proceed—with a persevering and confident prayer.</p>

<p>To move along the road to holiness, but especially when we feel the weight of our weaknesses, we have to recollect ourselves in prayer, in an intimate conversation with Our Lord.</p>

<p>Public prayer, or prayer in common, in which all the faithful take part, is holy and necessary, for God wishes also to see His children praying together (<em>cf</em>. Matt. 18:19-20).</p>

<p>But Our Lord’s commandment to us to “go into your inner room and shut the door upon yourself, and so pray to your Father in secret” (Matt. 6:6) should never be superseded.</p>

<p>The document on the liturgy of the Second Vatican Council, <em>Sacrosanctum Concilium</em>, says the liturgy is public prayer par excellence: “it is the summit toward which the activity of the Church is directed; it is also the fount from which all her power flows. …</p>

<p>“The spiritual life, however, is not limited solely to participation in the liturgy. The Christian indeed is called to pray with others, but he must also enter into their chamber to pray to the Father in secret (<em>cf</em>. Matt. 6:6); furthermore, according to St. Paul, they must ‘pray without ceasing’” (<em>cf</em>. 1 Thess. 5:17).</p>

<p>Prayer in company with other Christians ought also to be personal prayer; while the lips recite it at the proper pace and pauses, the mind gives it all her attention.</p>

<p>In prayer one speaks with God just as one converses with a friend—knowing that He is present, always attentive to what we are saying, listening to us, and replying. It is in such intimate conversation as the one that we are just now trying to have with God.</p>

<p>In these meditations we’re not just listening to a priest speaking. Hopefully we’re taking His words, making them our own, and directing them in a very personal way to Christ, to Jesus.</p>

<p>A priest doesn’t do your prayer for you. It’s your own raising up of the mind and heart to God. We have to try and work at our prayer to improve it all the time.</p>

<p>In that prayer, we throw our soul open to the Lord, to adore Him, to give Him thanks, to ask Him for help, and to go more deeply—as the apostles did—into the divine teachings. “Did not our hearts burn within us as he opened the Scriptures to us as we walked along the way?” (Luke 24:32).</p>

<p>As Our Lord opens the Scriptures to us and shows us new lights in the Scriptures, or in this event, or that event, or in our family, or in our work, hopefully we will continue to see new lights, new beginnings, that will draw us on into a deeper prayer and become more and more convinced of the importance and of the value of this activity.</p>

<p>In <em>The Way</em>, Point 91, we’re told, “You write: ‘To pray is to talk with God. But about what?’ About him, about yourself: joys, sorrows, successes and failures, noble ambitions, daily worries, weaknesses! And acts of thanksgiving and petitions, and Love and reparation. In a word, it’s worth getting to know him and to get to know yourself: ‘to get acquainted!’” (J. Escrivá, <em>The Way</em>, Point 91).</p>

<p>We could ask Our Lord for that grace to yearn to spend time with Him in prayer, and to thank Him for the grace that He has given to us in the past, maybe, years or decades of our life, where He has given us the grace of prayer.</p>

<p>Millions of people in the world have not been given that grace, and so it’s a talent we have to try and use well.</p>

<p>Our prayer ought never to be impersonal, anonymous, dispersed and lost in the crowd; because God, who has redeemed each individual person, wants to maintain a dialogue with each one: at the end of one’s life, salvation or condemnation will depend on the personal response of each one.</p>

<p>Prayer ought to be the dialogue of a particular person—one who has ideals, a specific job, specific friends, who has received specific graces from God, and wants to talk with his God about all of these things.</p>

<p>“When he rose from prayer, he went back to his disciples and found they were sleeping for sorrow.” Our Lord said, “‘How can you sleep? Rise up and pray, so that you may not enter into temptation’” (Luke 22:45-46).</p>

<p>The apostles had ignored Our Lord’s command. There may be many times in our life when we have been like the apostles. Possibly Our Lord has told us specific things, or things He wants us to do, or jobs to fulfill, or people to speak to.</p>

<p>Like the apostles, we’ve ignored His command. He may have told us those things through people, through places, through events, through spiritual direction, through means of formation, but somehow the penny didn’t drop; the message didn’t penetrate.</p>

<p>Our Lord had left them there, close to Himself, so that they would watch and pray, and so not fall into temptation.</p>

<p>But they’d been negligent. Even now, they don’t love Him enough and they allow themselves to be overcome by sleep and weakness, leaving Our Lord unaccompanied, alone, during that time of His agony.</p>

<p>If we ever find we’re overcome with the temptation to sleep, to get drowsy during our prayer, we could try and learn from this situation of the apostles.</p>

<p>We see, ‘What can I do to stay more awake? Can I kneel down, can I walk around the place? Can I do my mental prayer walking around? Do I need some sort of book, so I can look at certain topics or lines from time to time?’</p>

<p>In mental prayer, the focus is on talking with Our Lord. We glance at a line or two to help that conversation. In spiritual reading, our reading is continual reading, but in mental prayer, the reading of a few points is meant to facilitate our prayer.</p>

<p>Sleep, which is like the epitome of human weakness, has allowed an evil sadness to take hold of them: lack of spiritual struggle, abandonment of a life of piety.</p>

<p>There are lessons there for us about the importance of what the <em>Catechism of the Catholic Church</em> calls “the battle for prayer” (<em>Catechism</em>, Point 2725).</p>

<p>Occasionally in our life, we may all experience the battle for prayer. We shouldn’t expect that we can drift into our prayer as on a cloud every time we go to do our mental prayer.</p>

<p>Sometimes we might have to drag ourselves to pray. Or we might feel that our prayer is a comedy show, or we’re getting nothing out of it.</p>

<p>But St. Josemaría is very encouraging about those moments. He says, “Persevere in that prayer” (J. Escrivá, <em>The Way</em>, Point 101).</p>

<p>That prayer might be the best prayer you ever did because that prayer is all done for God and there are no human compensations.</p>

<p>If we maintain a living dialogue with God during each period of prayer, we will avoid getting into the situation of the apostles.</p>

<p>We will frequently resort to the Gospels or some other book that helps us to pray so that it can help us to channel our dialogue, to come closer to Our Lord, for whom no one or nothing can be a substitute. This is the way many saints have been made.</p>

<p>“During all those years,” says St. Teresa of Ávila, ‘except for after Communicating, I never dared begin to pray without a book; my soul was as much afraid to engage in prayer without one, as if it were having to go and fight against a host of enemies. With this help, which was a companion to me and a shield with which I could fight off the many blows of my many thoughts, I felt comforted” (Teresa of Ávila, <em>Life</em>).</p>

<p>It is really encouraging to know how the saints had to fight that battle for prayer.</p>

<p>We have to try and use all the means at our disposal to do our mental prayer in a recollected way. We should do it in the best place, according to our circumstances; and, whenever possible, in front of Our Lord in the tabernacle.</p>

<p>It should be done at the time we have already planned in our schedule for the normal day.</p>

<p>In the prayer we will always be on our guard against distractions. To a large extent, this can mean mortifying our memory and the imagination, keeping distant whatever may impede our attentiveness to God.</p>

<p>We have to avoid having “our senses awake and our soul asleep” (J. Escrivá, <em>The Way</em>, Point 368).</p>

<p>If we fight earnestly against temptations, Our Lord will make it easy for us to take up again the threads of our dialogue with Him. Our guardian angel too has the task of interceding on our behalf.</p>

<p>What’s important is that we do not want to be distracted, or that we have no intention of being willingly distracted during our time of prayer.</p>

<p>Involuntary distractions which may come about in spite of ourselves, and which we try to reject as soon as we’re aware of them, do not lessen the merit or the benefit of prayer. A father or a mother doesn’t get annoyed if the baby keeps uttering meaningless noises because it doesn’t yet know how to speak.</p>

<p>God knows our weaknesses and is patient, but we have to ask Him: Lord, “grant me the spirit of prayer” (Divine Office, <em>Lauds–Monday of Fourth Week of Lent</em>).</p>

<p>It pleases Our Lord when we resolve to improve our mental prayer each day of our lives—even on those occasions when things require more effort, are difficult, or when we feel arid.</p>

<p>“Prayer is not a question of what you say or feel, but of love. And you love when you try to say something to the Lord, even though you might not actually say anything” (J. Escrivá, <em>Furrow</em>, Point 464).</p>

<p>If this is our approach, then our life will be continually enriched and strengthened.</p>

<p>Every person can only truly know themselves with the light of God.</p>

<p>“All that we can know of ourselves through human means (life experiences, psychology, social sciences) are not to be denigrated…But those things give us a limited and partial knowledge of our being.</p>

<p>“We only have access to our profound identity through the light of God, in the regard that God has on us as the Father in heaven.</p>

<p>“This knowledge has a negative aspect, but it is one that leads to something positive. The negative aspect concerns our sin, our profound misery. We don’t recognize it except in the light of God.</p>

<p>“Faced with him, lies are no longer possible; there’s no escaping, no justification, no more masks to cling to. We’re obliged to recognize who we are, with our wounds, our weaknesses, our inconsistencies, our egoism, our hardness of heart, our secret complicities with evil.</p>

<p>“Happily, God is tender and merciful, and this light that is shed on us is done so progressively, as we are able to handle it. God only shows us our sin while simultaneously revealing his forgiveness and his mercy. We discover the sadness of our sinful condition, and also our absolute poverty as creatures” (Jacques Philippe, <em>Nine Days to Rediscover the Joy of Prayer</em>).</p>

<p>All this happens in our prayer. “This step toward truth is necessary: there is no healing without knowledge of the sickness. Only the truth makes us free.</p>

<p>“Fortunately, things don’t stop there. They lead on to something still more profound and infinitely beautiful: beyond our sins and our misery, the discovery of our condition as children of God. God loves us just as we are, with an absolutely unconditional love, and it’s this love that forms our deepest identity.</p>

<p>“More deep and essential than our human limits and the evil that affects us, there is at our base an intact and pure core, our identity as sons and daughters of God” (<em>ibid</em>.).</p>

<p>Prayer is a powerful lamp which throws light on our problems, enables us to get to know people better, and thus to help them on their path towards Christ, and to assign the proper place to the matters which preoccupy us.</p>

<p>Our prayer helps God to be the center of our lives. The more He’s there, the more we’re expecting everything from Him and from Him only, and the more our human relationships will have the chance to be well-adapted and happy.</p>

<p>“Experience shows us that faithfulness to prayer, even if it sometimes goes through difficult periods, moments of dryness, or trying times, progressively leads us to find in God a profound peace, a security, a happiness that makes us free with regard to others and to things” (<em>ibid</em>.).</p>

<p>Prayer locates the soul in an environment of serenity and of peace, which is then transmitted to others. The joy it produces is a foretaste of the happiness in heaven.</p>

<p>No one on this earth has known how to treat Jesus better than His Mother Mary, who spent long hours looking at Him, speaking with Him, handling Him with simplicity and veneration.</p>

<p>If we turn to Our Mother in heaven, we will learn quite quickly to follow Jesus confidently and to speak with Him very closely.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

Conor Donnelly</p>

<p>(<em>Proofread</em>)</p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>This feast celebrates the fact that St. Peter established his See in Rome. Christians were known to have celebrated this feast before the fourth century. The original name found on the ancient calendars was <em>Natale Petri de Cathedra</em>, which means the Birth of the Seat of Peter.</p>

<p>Our Lord said to Simon Peter, “I have prayed…that your faith may not fail, and…you in your turn must strengthen your brothers” (Luke 22:32).</p>

<p>The Chair of St. Peter refers to his seat of authority. The Fathers of the Church use this term as a symbol of a bishop’s authority, paying special regard to the Bishop of Rome.</p>

<p>In the third century, St. Cyprian wrote: “Peter holds primacy so as to show that Christ’s Church is one and that his Chair is one.” He goes on to emphasize the matter of unity when he says, “God is one. The Lord is one. The Church is one. The Chair founded by Christ is one” (Cyprian, <em>Epistle 43</em>).</p>

<p>For many years, the people of Rome had on display a wooden chair which St. Peter reputedly had sat upon. Pope St. Damasus moved this relic to the baptistery of the newly built Vatican in the fourth century.</p>

<p>The chair was seen and honored by thousands of pilgrims from all over the Christian world. At the time when the present Basilica of St. Peter was erected, it was thought advisable to preserve the chair in bronze and gold.</p>

<p>Before the fourth century, in the earliest liturgical calendars of the Church, one finds this feast, the Birth of the Seat of Peter. It is a celebration of the institution of the papacy.</p>

<p>This feast highlights the fact that the Bishop of Rome has jurisdiction throughout the entire world. It has been a long-standing custom to commemorate the consecration of bishops in their respective dioceses. Yet these commemorations pertain solely to the limits of each diocese. The Chair of Peter, however, is unique in that it extends to all Christianity and has done so from the first centuries.</p>

<p>St. Augustine says, “Our forefathers gave the name ‘Chair’ to this feast so that we might remember that the Prince of the Apostles was entrusted with the ‘Chair’ of the episcopate” (Augustine, <em>Sermon 15 on the Saints</em>). We can think on this feast day today about our love and our obedience to the Holy Father.</p>

<p>We know from the tradition of the Church, particularly from St. Leo the Great (<em>cf</em>. Leo I, <em>Homily 82 on the Feast of the Apostles Peter and Paul</em>), that St. Peter lived for a period of time in the city of Antioch, where the disciples, as we are told in the Acts, “were first called Christians” (Acts 11:26).</p>

<p>There he preached the Good News and then returned to Jerusalem, where a bloody persecution had broken out.</p>

<p>“At this time Herod the king set hands on certain members of the Church to persecute them. He killed James, the brother of John, with the sword, and seeing that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also, during the days of the Unleavened Bread,” as we are told in the Acts (Acts 12:3).</p>

<p>Freed from prison by the intercession of an angel, Peter left Palestine and “went to another place” (Acts 12:17). The <em>Acts of the Apostles</em> doers not state specifically where Peter went, but tradition tells us that he began to make his way to the Eternal City.</p>

<p>St. Jerome claims that Peter arrived in Rome during the second year of the reign of Claudius, about 43 A.D., and remained there for twenty-five years until his death (Jerome, <em>De Viris Illustribus</em>).</p>

<p>Other authors believe that Peter made two trips to Rome: one immediately following his captivity in Jerusalem, and having gone to Palestine on the occasion of the Council of Jerusalem in 49 AD, he returned to Rome. Later he carried out other missionary journeys.</p>

<p>St. Peter arrived at this, the capital of the world, “to better spread the light of the truth from the head to the rest of the body,” said St. Leo the Great.</p>

<p>“What race was not represented in this city? What peoples would ignore what Rome said? This was the proper place to refute false philosophies, to challenge the foolishness of purely human reasoning, to destroy the empty sacrifices of the cults. For it was to Rome that all the different errors had come together” (Leo I, <em>loc. cit</em>.)</p>

<p>The fisherman from Galilee became the rock and the foundation of the Church. He chose to establish this foundation in the Eternal City. Here he preached the Good News as he had done in Judea, in Samaria, in Galilee, and in Antioch.</p>

<p>From his Chair in Rome, Peter governed the whole Church. It was there in Rome that Peter gave up his own life for the faith in imitation of the Master.</p>

<p>The tomb of the Prince of the Apostles lies directly beneath the main altar of St. Peter’s Basilica. This has been the constant tradition and it has recently been confirmed by archaeological investigation. The tomb serves as an enduring symbol that Simon Peter is by divine election the Church’s firm foundation. The voice of our Savior can be heard down through the centuries in the teachings of the Roman Pontiffs.</p>

<p>Today’s Gospel reminds us of the immortal promise made by Jesus to Peter and all of his successors as Pope: “I say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven” (Matt. 16:18-19).</p>

<p>I was in St. Peter’s for the inauguration of the pontificate of Pope John Paul II. There was a moment in that ceremony when all the, I think, a hundred-plus cardinals filed up to promise their obedience to the Pope.</p>

<p>During that time, the choir was singing these words: <em>Tu es Petrus, et super hanc petram aedificabo Ecclesiam meam</em>. “You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my Church.”</p>

<p>That part of the ceremony took about half an hour, so we heard these words over and over again. It was very moving, very beautiful, very impressive. When you hear those words repeated so many times, it leaves a mark. That’s all that I remember of that particular occasion.</p>

<p>When his successor, Pope Benedict, was elected, he decided to change that part of the ceremony. Instead of having a hundred cardinals, he had one cardinal, one bishop, one priest, and one married couple representing the whole of the Church. It was finished in five minutes. But it reflected the very clear teaching of the Second Vatican Council.</p>

<p>St. Augustine comments, “Blessed be God, who deigned to exalt the Apostle Peter over the whole Church. It is most fitting that this foundation be honored since it is a means by which we may ascend to heaven” (Augustine, <em>Sermon 15 on the Saints</em>).</p>

<p>Acting from Rome, Peter consoled, instructed, and strengthened the many Christian churches which were developing throughout the Roman Empire.</p>

<p>In the First Reading of today’s Mass, Peter exhorts Church leaders in Asia Minor to shepherd their flocks with charity. He says, “Tend the flock of God which is among you, governing not under constraint, but willingly, according to God; nor yet for the sake of base gain, but eagerly” (1 Pet. 5:2).</p>

<p>These words of Peter hearken back to the teaching of the Master about the Good Shepherd (John 10:1 <em>ff</em>). We may specifically recall that moving scene after the Resurrection when Jesus said to Simon Peter: “Feed my lambs. … Feed my sheep” (John 21:15-17).</p>

<p>This is the mission which Our Lord has entrusted to Peter and to each of his successors: to take good care of the Lord’s flock, to confirm the faith of the People of God; to safeguard doctrine and customs; to interpret the truths contained in divine Revelation with the help of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>St. Peter writes in his Second Epistle: “Therefore I shall begin to remind you always of these things; although indeed you know them and are well established in the present truth. As long as I am in this tabernacle, I think it right to arouse you by a reminder, knowing as I do that the putting off of my tabernacle is at hand, just as Our Lord Jesus Christ signified to me. Moreover, I will endeavor that after my death you may have occasion to call these things to mind” (2 Pet. 1:12-15).</p>

<p>Today’s feast gives us a good opportunity to deepen our filial devotion to the Holy Father and to his teachings. We should remember the quality of our personal commitment to know his teachings and to put them into practice.</p>

<p>Love for the Pope is a good indicator of our love for Christ. This love and veneration needs to be specified in daily prayer and sacrifice for his intentions.</p>

<p>“May the Lord preserve him and give him life and make him blessed on earth and not deliver him up to the will of his enemies” (<em>Enchiridion Indulgentiarum</em>, prayer <em>pro Pontifice</em>).</p>

<p>We should show this love in real life: whenever we make a trip for apostolic purposes, when we are sick, whenever people are attacking the Church, when we are introducing our friends to the faith.</p>

<p>St. Josemaría in <em>The Way</em> says, “Catholic, apostolic, Roman! I want you to be very Roman, ever anxious to make your ‘pilgrimage’ to Rome, <em>videre Petrum</em>—to see Peter” (Josemaría Escrivá, <em>The Way</em>, Point 520).</p>

<p>There are a number of passages in Scripture that remind us of our love for the Pope and of our unity to the Holy Father.</p>

<p>We’re told in St. Peter: “You had gone astray like sheep but now you have returned to the shepherd and guardian of your souls” (1 Pet. 2:25).</p>

<p>In St. John, Our Lord says, “I am the gate. Anyone who enters through me will be safe. Such a one will go in and out and will find pasture. The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I have come so that they may have life and have it to the full” (John 10:9-10).</p>

<p>“And there are other sheep I have that are not of this fold, and I must lead these too. They too will listen to my voice, and there will be one flock, one shepherd” (John 10:16).</p>

<p>In St. Luke, He says, “But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail, and once you have recovered, you in your turn must strengthen your brothers” (Luke 22:32).</p>

<p>And again in St. John, “The Father, for what he has given me, is greater than anyone, and no one can steal anything from the Father’s hand” (John 10:29).</p>

<p>“When the chief shepherd appears, you will be given the unfading crown of glory” (1 Pet. 5:4).</p>

<p>“When they had eaten, Jesus said to Simon Peter, ‘Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these do?’ He answered, ‘Yes, Lord, you know I love you.’ Jesus said to him, ‘Feed my lambs’” (John 21:15).</p>

<p>“I am the vine, you are the branches. Whoever remains in me, with me in him, bears fruit in plenty; for cut off from me you can do nothing” (John 15:5).</p>

<p>“Around the time that those words were spoken, Herod the king started persecuting certain members of the Church. He had James, the brother of John, beheaded. When he saw this pleased the Jews, he went on to arrest Peter as well. As it was during the days of Unleavened Bread that he had arrested him, he put him in prison, assigning four sections of four soldiers each to guard him, meaning to try him in public after the Passover. All the time Peter was under guard, the Church prayed to God for him unremittingly.</p>

<p>“On the night before Herod was to try him, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, fastened with two chains, while guards kept watch at the main entrance to the prison. Then suddenly an angel of the Lord stood there, and the cell was filled with light.</p>

<p>“The angel tapped Peter on the side and woke him. ‘Get up!’ he said, ‘Hurry!’ The chains fell from his hands. The angel then said, ‘Put on your belt and sandals.’ After he had done this, the angel next said, ‘Wrap your cloak around you and follow me.’</p>

<p>“He followed him out, but had no idea what the angel did was all happening in reality; he thought he was seeing a vision. They passed through the first guard post and the second, and reached the iron gate leading to the city. This opened of its own accord. They went through it and had walked the whole length of one street when suddenly the angel left him.</p>

<p>“It was only then that Peter came to himself, and he said, ‘Now I know it is all true. The Lord really did send his angel and save me from Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting.’ As soon as he realized this, he went straight to the house of Mary, the mother of John Mark, where a number of people had assembled and were praying” (Acts 12:1-12).</p>

<p>In the <em>Communion Antiphon</em> of the Mass, we’re told, “The Good Shepherd is risen. He who laid down his life for his sheep, who died for his flock, he is risen, Alleluia.”</p>

<p>Our Lord, the Good Shepherd, entrusts Peter and his successors with the government of the Church to continue His mission on earth. The sacrifice of the Shepherd gave life to His sheep and brought them back to the fold.</p>

<p>Years later, St. Peter confirmed Christians in their faith by reminding them, in the midst of persecution, what Christ had done and suffered for them. He wrote, “By his wounds you have been healed. For you were straying like sheep, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls” (1 Pet. 2:24-25).</p>

<p>The whole Church prays that “the continuing work of the Redeemer will bring us eternal joy” (<em>Prayer over the Offerings</em>), and asks God the Father to “give us new strength from the courage of Christ our Shepherd, and lead us to join the saints in heaven” (<em>Collect</em>).</p>

<p>The early Christians had a special affection for the image of the Good Shepherd and left countless testimonies of it in the catacombs and on many well-known ancient buildings through murals, reliefs, gravestone etchings, mosaics, and sculptures.</p>

<p>We are invited to contemplate our Savior’s merciful tenderness so that we may recognize the rights He acquired over each one of us by His death. It’s also good in our prayer to consider our love for the good shepherds whom He has left to guide us and keep us in His name.</p>

<p>Every day we should pray for the Holy Father and remind our children to pray for the Holy Father, and educate them little by little on who the Pope is and how much he needs our support and our affection.</p>

<p>When I was about six or seven, my father made me send a Christmas card to the Pope. I had to make it myself. He got a few sheets of hard paper, and then I had to draw an Irish mountain, and one line up and one line down—I had no artistic talents—and then a little cottage, and smoke coming out of the cottage on the hillside. The mountain had to be painted gray, and the cottage had to be painted white, and the smoke had to be gray, and the fields had to be green. Then I made a mistake, and I had to do the whole thing over again. I couldn’t wait to be finished; I didn’t know what all this was about.</p>

<p>Then it was sent off to Rome. There’s a policy in St. Peter’s that they always reply to every letter that they get. So a few months later, a card came back.</p>

<p>The first line said, “The Secretariat of State of His Holiness.” I didn’t know what that meant. But that card had to be framed and put on the wall. It took me a couple of years before I could get to the second and third line to understand the big words.</p>

<p>But when I came in contact with Opus Dei, then I realized what it was my father was trying to teach me ten years previously: to have a love for the Holy Father.</p>

<p>The Old Testament frequently refers to the Messiah as a Good Shepherd who must feed, rule, and govern God’s people who were often abandoned and scattered. The prophecies of the awaited Shepherd are fulfilled in Jesus, but in Him with new features.</p>

<p>He is the Good Shepherd who gives life for His sheep and who provides other shepherds to continue His mission. As opposed to thieves who seek their own interests and destroy the flock, Jesus is the door of salvation; he who enters will find abundant pasture (<em>cf</em>. John. 10:9).</p>

<p>There is a tender relationship between Jesus the Good Shepherd and His sheep. He calls each by his name. He leads them. The sheep follow because they know His voice. He is the one and only Shepherd who has only “one flock” (<em>cf</em>. John 10:16), protected by the Father’s love (<em>cf</em>. John 10:29), and He is “the chief Shepherd” (1 Pet. 5:4).</p>

<p>In His last appearance before the Ascension, the risen Christ made Peter the shepherd of His flock. In this way the prophecy made to Peter before the Passion was fulfilled: “But I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail; and when you have turned again, strengthen your brethren” (Luke 22:32). Then He prophesied that as a good shepherd, He would die for His flock.</p>

<p>Our Lord trusts Peter in spite of the denials. He simply asks for His love the same number of times that He had been denied. Our Lord doesn’t mind entrusting His Church to a weak man who repents and loves with deeds.</p>

<p>“Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, ‘Do you love me?’ and he said to him, ‘Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you.’ Jesus said to him, ‘Feed my sheep’” (John 21:17). The shepherd symbol which Jesus claimed for Himself is passed on to Peter. He must continue Our Lord’s mission and be His representative on earth.</p>

<p>Our Lord’s words to Peter—“Feed my lambs, feed my sheep”—explain Peter’s mission as one of guarding Our Lord’s flock without limitations. The word and verb ‘feed’ is equivalent to ‘direct and govern.’ That is what Peter is entrusted with.</p>

<p>Peter is made the shepherd and the guide for the whole Church. The Second Vatican Council wrote, “Jesus Christ put Peter at the head of the other apostles, and in him he set up a lasting and visible source and foundation of the unity of both faith and communion” (Vatican II, <em>Lumen gentium</em>, Point 18, November 21, 1964).</p>

<p>There’s a saying in Latin that says: <em>Ubi Petrus ibi Ecclesia</em>-where Peter is, there is Christ’s Church. In union with him, we know with certainty the way that leads to salvation.</p>

<p>The Church is built on the primacy of Peter, as on a rock, until the end of the world. Peter’s stature is immeasurably enhanced since Christ is the real foundation of the Church (1 Cor. 3:11), and Peter now takes His place. That’s why his successors have since acquired the title of Vicar of Christ, that is, one who takes the place of Christ.</p>

<p>Peter is the Church’s strong defense against the storms she has suffered and will suffer throughout the centuries. Built on him, as foundation and with his watchfulness as good shepherd, its victory is assured despite trials and temptations.</p>

<p>Peter must eventually die, but as regards his role of supreme shepherd, the First Vatican Council said, “Our Lord will assure it lasts eternally for the perpetual health and perennial good of the Church, which, being founded on rock, must remain stable to the end of time” (Vatican I, <em>Pastor aeternus</em>, Chapter 2, July 18, 1870).</p>

<p>Love for the Pope goes back to the Church’s beginnings. The <em>Acts of the Apostles</em> tell us movingly of the early Christians’ reaction to the imprisonment of St. Peter by Herod Agrippa, who planned to kill him when the Paschal feast was over. Meanwhile, the Church prayed unceasingly to God for him (<em>cf</em>. Acts 12:1-12).</p>

<p>“Look at how the faithful feel for their pastors,” says St. John Chrysostom. They don’t resort to protest or rebellion, but to prayer as an unfailing remedy. They did not say: as we are powerless men, it is useless to pray for him. They never reasoned in this way, but they prayed with love” (John Chrysostom, <em>Homilies on the Acts of the Apostles</em>).</p>

<p>We ought to pray a lot for the Pope and his intentions since he bears the heavy weight of the Church on his shoulders. Every day the clamor of the entire Church, spread over the world, rises to God in petition for him and with him. No Mass is celebrated without his name being mentioned, and prayers are said for him and his intentions.</p>

<p>Our Lord will be very pleased to see that throughout the day we remember to offer our prayers, our hours of work or study, or some mortifications, for His Vicar on earth.</p>

<p>St. Josemaría said in <em>The Way</em>, “Thank you, my God, for that love for the Pope that you have placed in my heart” (J. Escrivá, <em>The Way</em>, Point 573).</p>

<p>It would be wonderful if we could say this prayer more meaningfully every day. Love and veneration for the Roman Pontiff is one of the great gifts Our Lord has left us.</p>

<p>We can turn to Our Lady, Mother of the Church, and ask her in a special way to look after our Holy Father, protect him and guide him and enlighten him. May he be a symbol of unity for the whole world.</p>

<p>Help us, Mary, in the course of our life, to feel a greater responsibility to pray more and to be more united to the Holy Father as we progress in our life.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p>(<em>Proofread</em>)</p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

<p><em>My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p>“Be you perfect, therefore, as also your heavenly Father is perfect” (Matt. 5:48).</p>

<p>By virtue of Baptism, the Christian carries supernatural, sanctifying grace in his soul. This is the seed, the root, of supernatural life. As every healthy seed carries within it the urge to grow and unfold, so also with the sanctifying grace within us.</p>

<p>Every baptized person comes under the law of impulse to growth and fulfillment. If a person was to try to escape this law and refuse to grow, he would necessarily wither and decline.</p>

<p>Every created life encounters disturbing forces that seek to hinder its development. And so too, there are many evil elements threatening the existence of supernatural life.</p>

<p>Anyone who is not earnestly concerned with fostering their supernatural life eventually succumbs to these disturbing forces. That’s why we must never hesitate but go on and on.</p>

<p>“The fundamental duty of every Christian is to press earnestly towards the goal of perfection, to become more perfect, moment by moment. Only in this way can we preserve our supernatural life and ensure its unfolding” (Benedict Baur, <em>In Silence With God</em>).</p>

<p>“Be perfect.” With inexpressible love the Lord has taken us up into His own life in the sacrament of Baptism, that we may “partake of his divine nature” (2 Pet. 1:4). Powerful phrase of St. Peter, that we would [be taken up into God’s own life].</p>

<p>In addition to the supernatural life principle of sanctifying grace, He has given us the three divine virtues—of faith, of hope, and of love—as well as feet to carry us to Him, arms with which to receive Him, and a plenitude of so-called moral virtues—like justice, prudence, strength, temperance—with which to circumvent the daily influence of earthly things, and in that way strengthen the gifts of the Holy Spirit, which in fact are supernatural prerequisites for a perfect, holy life.</p>

<p>Grafted to Christ, the vine (Rom. 11:17), in Baptism, we automatically become children of the Church (<em>Catechism</em>, Point 1213)—“ours, the holy, God-inspired writings of the Old and New Testament; ours, the sacraments; ours, the mystery of Christ in the blessed Eucharist as sacrifice and spiritual nourishment; ours, the rewards and virtues, the prayers and satisfactions of Christ in His holy, pure, God-loving soul in heaven and on earth” (<em>ibid</em>.)</p>

<p>In Baptism, God Himself—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—lovingly takes residence in our soul, to be near to us, to draw us into His divine life, and secretly to copy and develop it in us.</p>

<p>It is not only possible, but imperative, for us to “become perfect, as our Father in heaven is perfect.”</p>

<p>Just as Baptism is the sacrament of rebirth, so Confirmation is the sacrament of fulfillment. As at Pentecost, the Holy Spirit descended upon the apostles, so He descends upon us Christians in confirmation, bringing us the strength to bear testimony for Christ.</p>

<p>How do we do that? Primarily by leading a life “dead unto the sins of the world” (Rom. 6:11), and then by allowing the intentions and virtues of Christ to light up in us, that we may become like another Christ, ready to make every sacrifice and put forth every effort to resist all things that might be contrary to our union with God.</p>

<p>In the sacrament of Confirmation, we receive the power and strength to attain maturity and perfection in Christian life. Confirmation urges us to take the first faltering steps toward Christian fulfillment: “Be you perfect.”</p>

<p>Ever anew, we are called to assist in the sacrifice of the Mass, that we may actively participate in the offering up of Christ, uniting ourselves with Him in the offering.</p>

<p>Whenever we receive Holy Communion worthily, or assist in the sacrifice with the priest, we renew the redemption Christ earned for us on the Cross. We join in His sacrifice, making His intentions and His objects our own.</p>

<p>When Our Lord, in Holy Communion, gives Himself for our soul’s nourishment, He fills us to the depths of our being with His spirit and His sacrificial power.</p>

<p>Then we become strong to cope with our daily tasks. All our efforts and strivings can be permeated with the Christ-like spirit of surrender to the glory of God.</p>

<p>In this way, the Christian can turn their entire day into one unbroken sacrifice of prayer, thanksgiving, praise, and expiation, by beginning it with Holy Communion, offering up everything that God’s will has imposed upon us to do, to endure, or to suffer.</p>

<p>Participation in Mass gives us the daily opportunity to enter more fully into Our Lord’s spirit of sacrifice, into His surrender to the Father, into His obedience unto death.</p>

<p>Every day it renews and intensifies our need to draw from Holy Communion the courage and strength to unite ourselves in an innermost spiritual wholeness with Christ, completely absorbed in His will, so that we may offer ourselves totally with Him and fulfill the command: “Be you perfect.”</p>

<p>In the first place, this means fulfilling God’s will. Who is it that submits to every demand for the honor of God; who surrenders themselves completely, without reserve, to the guidance and providence of God, than the person who is perfect?</p>

<p>One perfect soul glorifies God more than thousands of imperfect souls, because a single act of love on the part of a perfect soul is more pleasing to God than the sum total of all the incomplete acts of love offered by those who have not reached perfection.</p>

<p>But the perfect soul is constantly occupied in such acts of perfect love.</p>

<p>And so, if we wish truly and eagerly to worship Our Lord, our constant aim should be to rise above our shortcomings and reach perfection.</p>

<p>In the second place, “Be you perfect” means the well-being of our soul. The more we occupy ourselves with the attainment of perfection, the more surely we will guard ourselves against sin, against every sin, however unimportant it might seem.</p>

<p>The person who wrestles for perfection withstands the many opportunities and temptations that lead to evil. That person never loses sight of the ideal spurring him on, leaving him no peace. He has no time for half-measures.</p>

<p>“Be you perfect.” We need saints in these times. St. Josemaría and many people who came after him—Pope Benedict, Pope John Paul II—have talked about “these times are times for saints” (<em>cf</em>. Josemaría Escrivá, <em>The Way</em>, Point 301).</p>

<p>Sometimes we hear that conditions in the world today are hopeless, that we can’t go on. What can save the world today? Pope Francis has also emphasized that only the holiness of Christians can do so (<em>cf</em>. Apostolic Exhortation, <em>Gaudete et exsultate</em>, Point 6, March 19, 2018).</p>

<p>We need perfect Christians, perfect priests and nuns, perfect fathers and mothers, perfect students, officials, workers, and employers.</p>

<p>If anyone wishes to render a true service to the world, to the Church, to his country, to mankind, to himself, he must start with himself by subordinating everything to the pursuit and attainment of perfection.</p>

<p>There was a piece of news recently about a religious order in New York, I think called the Daughters of Charity (Sisters of Charity of New York), who have decided not to receive any more vocations and are sort of closing down. They feel they’ve reached the end of their mission after 150 years.</p>

<p>Pope St. John Paul II said this will happen to many religious orders. Many people who are there are elderly. But then in the next paragraph that announced this, they said that in the last 150 years, this religious order had started 160 schools, twenty-eight hospitals, a college of liberal arts, and quite a number of other things.</p>

<p>Sort of pause for a moment. Hundred and something schools, twenty-eight hospitals! One religious order did that over 150 years!</p>

<p>The history of some of these religious orders is truly incredible. What people have achieved with their lives!</p>

<p>And if you asked any one of those people involved in those organizations, I don’t think they’d tell you, ‘We were just here to build schools and to start hospitals.’</p>

<p>You’ll find this commitment to holiness and perfection was at the basis of all their endeavors. Over time, this yields this abundant fruit.</p>

<p>We have an awful lot to be proud of in our Church. It’s also important that we have a good knowledge of our history, and of the great things that people of the Catholic Church have achieved in society in the past hundreds of years, so that we see what <em>we</em> have to achieve in the 21st and 22nd centuries.</p>

<p>We might find ourselves surrounded today by a very unchristian world, a very worldly spirit in many places, in hearts, and in minds. We might think the world has never been in such a bad state.</p>

<p>But if you get to know a little bit more about history, you’ll find the opposite is the truth. The times we live in are no better or no worse than many other eras.</p>

<p>We might find the world is in a bit of a mess, in spite of all the effort on the part of ecclesiastical authorities or religious orders, or in spite of so many good books and writings, so many missions or congresses, or sermons, or Confessions, or Communions, or pilgrimages.</p>

<p>The build-up may be magnificent; the results might seem meager and impermanent. Over and over again, the Evil One arrives to sow his weeds, and “the weeds can choke the good seed” (<em>cf</em>. Matt. 13:22).</p>

<p>But yet you look back after 150 years and you see a glowing treasure.</p>

<p>In truth there’s only one cure, one solution—the earnest striving for perfection, the full realization of living active Christian virtue—in a word, Christian holiness, and this has to have deep roots.</p>

<p>The soul of perfection is the inner life, turning from worldliness, breaking with every conscious sin and attachment to anything other than God, and to anything that can hinder our union with God.</p>

<p>We have to practice renunciation, and contrition, and atonement, taking care of our spiritual life, our prayer, our meditation, and working with the spirit of love so that we also put perfection into our work, because that’s the role of the ordinary layperson in the middle of the world: to sanctify the temporal realities, the world of work. That’s what our vocation in the middle of the world is all about.</p>

<p>That is why the present times demand of Christians a life of Christian perfection because this alone is what will change things.</p>

<p>When we love, we are perfect. “You shall love the Lord your God with your whole heart, and with your whole soul, and with your whole mind…and your neighbor as yourself” (Matt. 22:37,39).</p>

<p>Love is the highest expression, the ultimate term, of our capacity. In love, we gather up our whole being—our feelings, our will, our endeavor, our giving ourselves, with all that we possess and all that we are capable of—to the one that we love.</p>

<p>God is glorified by love more than by anything else. Love most completely fulfills His commandments.</p>

<p>We’re told in St. Matthew that on the commandments to love God and our neighbor “hang the whole law and the prophets” (Matt. 22:40).</p>

<p>All the commandments and duties refer to love. Love is the fulfillment of commandments and duties; without love, there is no fulfillment. It’s the soul of all the virtues; it is itself all virtues.</p>

<p>If love is lacking, all is lacking. “If I do not have love,” says St. Paul, “I have nothing, I am nothing” (<em>cf</em>. 1 Cor. 13:2). Where love is, there all things are, including all the other virtues.</p>

<p>These virtues grow as naturally out of love as out of their own roots: they serve love and smooth its path to such an extent that the loving soul easily and readily does everything that love demands.</p>

<p>We are just as perfect as the love that we bear. Bear to whom? To God and to our neighbor.</p>

<p>That is why God makes love the sign by which His disciples may be known. “By this will all men know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another” (John 13:35).</p>

<p>In the same way, the Apostle measures our love for God by the love that we bear toward our neighbors. In the first Letter of St. John, he says, “For he that loves not his brother…how can he love God?” (1 John 4:20).</p>

<p>The love with which we love God and our brother in Christ is the same. Only the motive differs. We love God for His own sake; our brother, through the will of God and Christ.</p>

<p>The concept of perfection, which many people entertain, may be deceptive and destructive. Perfection does not consist of extraordinary penances or fasting or the greatest possible sacrifices.</p>

<p>Some might think that we’re perfect and they’re perfect when they are free from temptation and strife, when they can pray plentifully without any trouble, when they experience comfort and sweetness in prayer, when they are able to pray just as they wish to pray.</p>

<p>Or they might think that they’re perfect if they follow the rules and regulations to the letter. Mortifications, zeal in prayer, observance of rules are indispensable for spiritual perfection, but they’re not perfection in themselves.</p>

<p>There might be many among the mortified, among the ardent worshippers, many rule-abiding people, who might be unyielding in their judgment.</p>

<p>They might be proud and vain, obstinate and opinionated, fault-finding, lacking love in thought and speech, hypersensitive, jealous, easily put out, moody and uncontrolled. These can hardly be called perfect.</p>

<p>We are just as perfect as the love we bear, when love is within reach of all who are in a state of sanctifying grace, who keep God’s commandments, who commit no mortal sin.</p>

<p>And is such a one truly perfect? Not necessarily, because perfection demands more than this. It rules out not only all mortal sin but every conscious, venial sin.</p>

<p>It declares war on every fault of which it becomes aware. It tolerates no neglect, no half-measures, no easygoing indifference, no fault of character—even though it cannot prevent man here on earth from often falling victim to unconscious weaknesses and faults of human nature.</p>

<p>Perfection consists particularly of doing all that is good that is possible in given circumstances and situations—and not only what is commanded or cannot be omitted without sinning.</p>

<p>It extends beyond the sphere of duty. It does not ask, ‘Must I do this?’ ‘Is it a sin if I do it or don’t do it?’</p>

<p>And any good we have an opportunity to perform must be complete: outwardly perfect, performed in a proper and careful manner, leaving no room for the least reproach of negligence; inwardly perfect, springing from an intention of pure love, sincerely first for the sake of God’s will and Christ’s.</p>

<p>But we are really perfect only when it has become a habit, second nature, to regulate our thoughts and actions entirely with reference to God, His will, His honor and glory, yielding in all things to His good pleasure.</p>

<p>Perfection rests upon love, that is to say, on the complete fulfillment of the commandment: “You shall love the Lord your God…with your whole soul, and with your whole mind…and your neighbor as yourself” (Matt. 22:37,39).</p>

<p>Whoever loves anything more than God, whoever loves anything opposed to God, whoever loves in the same degree anything that is not God, fails to fulfill the commandment of love and consequently is not on the road to perfection.</p>

<p>If that person wishes to take the way of a perfect life, they must in some measure fulfill the law of love.</p>

<p>Christians have a wide field of endeavor in seeking perfection, because perfection, like love, has unlimited forms.</p>

<p>We can talk about two kinds of Christian perfection: essential perfection and perfection in a narrower and more particular sense.</p>

<p>Essential perfection may be described as perfection in a wider sense—that perfection without which no one can attain the goal of Christian life: eternal life in God.</p>

<p>This requires not only the fulfillment of the commandments but, over and above that, doing everything that is necessary to remain in a state of grace.</p>

<p>If a Christian were only to do or leave undone that which he is strictly commanded by the law to do or not to do, he would still not fulfill Christ’s command, “Be you perfect.”</p>

<p>If such a person were to practice brotherly love only when it was indicated by strict duty, where it could not be withheld without sin, they would have fulfilled the law of brotherly love in only the minimum of cases.</p>

<p>A person who never goes beyond the strict letter of the law is still a long way from essential perfection.</p>

<p>Perfection in the particular and narrower sense goes far beyond essential perfection. It not only fulfills the law but seeks to carry out every recommendation, every good act suggested by God and Christ.</p>

<p>Passing beyond what is strictly commanded or forbidden, this species of perfection consists of a positive eagerness to excel in the more difficult tasks, renunciations, and sacrifices.</p>

<p>Wherever the soul may most heroically prove its love, those striving for higher perfection are to be found, performing their tasks carefully, punctually, with complete devotion, self-surrender, and endurance.</p>

<p>We’re told that Our Lady went “with haste into the hill country” (Luke 1:39). She went quickly, with enthusiasm, with initiative, with daring, with the fortitude to face the challenges, to perform that corporal act of mercy with her cousin Elizabeth; and, with great fortitude, did not tell Joseph where she was going, placing her vocation first.</p>

<p>We can ask Our Lady that we might follow in her example to lead a life of striving for that perfection that we see in her who is the model of all the virtues.</p>

<p><em>I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.</em></p>

<p><em>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</em></p>

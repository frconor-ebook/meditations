Our Sins, Our Confession

By Fr. Conor Donnelly

(*Proofread*)

*In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
Amen.*

*My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see
me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your
pardon for my sins and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My
Immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel,
intercede for me.*

In the Book of Isaiah, we\'re told**, "**Prepare the way of the Lord in
the wilderness, make straight in the desert a highway for our God. Every
valley shall be lifted up and every mountain and hill be made low.; the
uneven ground shall become level, and the rough places a plain."

The best way of getting our souls ready to receive Our Lord at His
coming is to make a really well-prepared confession. This Sacrament is a
source of grace and mercy throughout our entire life, but its necessity
is especially obvious in this season, and through her liturgy, the
Church urges and encourages us to prepare to commemorate the birth of
Our Lord at Christmas.

She puts on our lips a prayerful petition in the liturgy: "O God, who
sent your Son into the world to free the human race from its former
sinfulness. As we faithfully wait for His coming, fill our hearts with
your grace, so that we may live in true freedom and attain its reward."

Confession is also the sacrament which, together with the Blessed
Eucharist, prepares us for that all-important meeting with Christ at the
end of our life. Our whole life is, in this sense, a continual Advent, a
preparation for that final moment for which we are unceasingly, day by
day, getting ourselves ready.

It's comforting to realize that it is this same Lord who urgently
desires to have us with Him in "the new heaven and the new earth" which
He has prepared for us.

Every well-made confession is an impulse which Our Lord gives us to go
ahead, freed from our miseries, with new courage and joy. Christ says to
us once more: "Take heart, your sins are forgiven" (Mt 9:2), my child,
begin again\.... It is He Himself who forgives us when we have humbly
told Him our faults.

Pope St. John Paul said we confess our sins "to God Himself, although in
the confessional, it is a man---the priest---who listens to us. That man
is the humble and faithful servant of this great mystery which has been
enacted between the son who returns and the Father.

"The causes of evil are not to be found outside man, but, above all, in
the depth of his heart. Its cure also comes from the heart.
Consequently, Christians must rebel against the debasing of man, through
a sincere determination to be truly converted themselves, and must show
forth in their own lives the joy of being truly freed from sin\...by
means of their sincere repentance, their firm resolution of amendment,
and the courageous confession of their faults."

For those who have fallen into mortal sin after they have been baptized,
this Sacrament of Penance is as necessary for their salvation as is
Baptism for those who have not yet been reborn into supernatural life.

"It is the means to satisfy man, but the righteousness that comes from
the Redeemer Himself." The Church holds its importance to be so great
that "lack of time may oblige priests to postpone or even to omit other
activities, but never that of hearing Confessions."

All mortal sins committed after Baptism, together with any circumstances
which may affect their nature, must be brought to the tribunal of
Penance in an individual confession made privately to a priest, followed
by individual absolution.

Pope St. John Paul asks us to do everything that we can "to help the
ecclesial community to appreciate fully 'the value of individual
Confession' as a personal encounter with the merciful and loving Savior,
and to be faithful to the directives of the Church in a matter of such
importance. We cannot forget that conversion is a particularly profound
inward act in which the individual cannot be replaced by others and
cannot make the community a substitute for him."

As well as being *complete* in regard to serious sins, Confession must
be *supernatural: w*e have to remember that we are coming to implore
forgiveness from the same Lord whom we have offended, because all sins,
including those committed against our fellow man, are direct offenses
against God.

A confession made with consciousness of its supernatural nature is a
real act of love for God. In the depth of our soul, we hear Christ say,
as He said to Peter, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?" And we too
can answer, in the very words of the Apostle, "Lord, you know
everything, you know that I love you---in spite of everything.

Next to mortal sin, venial sin is the soul\'s greatest misery, because
it prevents us from receiving many actual graces. Each small
unfaithfulness is the loss of a great treasure: it decreases the warmth
of our love; it increases our difficulty in practicing the virtues,
which seem harder and harder each time. And it makes it easier for us to
end up committing mortal sin, unless we react promptly.

Our greatest help in the struggle to avoid venial sin comes from Holy
Communion and frequent Confession. In Confession we are given special
graces to avoid precisely those defects and sins which we have confessed
and repented.

To value frequent Confession is a sign of spiritual refinement and love
of God. To despise it or to be indifferent to it suggests inward
coarseness and frequently a real blindness to supernatural realities.

How often we should go to Confession depends on the needs of each
individual soul. Anyone who is seriously determined to fulfill the Will
of God in everything and to belong entirely to God will feel a real need
to come to this sacrament more often and more regularly.

Pope St. John Paul says: Confession periodically renewed---the
Confession of devotion---has always accompanied the ascent to holiness
in the Church.

In the Sacrament of Penance, each person is reconciled with God and with
the Church. It\'s one of the most intimate and personal of human acts,
and brings about many fundamental changes in the sanctuary of each
man\'s conscience.

At the same time, this Sacrament also possesses a deep and inseparable
social dimension and also brings about many changes in the family
circle, in studies, in our work, in the friendly relationships of the
person who goes to Confession.

Scott Han tells a story that after he had converted to Catholicism---his
wife had not yet converted---when one Saturday afternoon, she came to
him and asked, "How long has it been since your last Confession?"

He said he felt a bit irked by this rather personal question coming from
his wife, who didn\'t even believe in the Sacrament of Confession. He
more or less said to her, "Why, what\'s it to you?" And she said, "All I
know is that when you come from Confession, you\'re kinder to me and the
kids."

He said very sheepishly, "I had to admit, three weeks." Later that
afternoon, with a great humility, he said, "I looked for my car keys and
I went off to find my confessor." It was a testimony from his wife of
the social benefits of being in the state of grace and of getting to the
Sacrament.

The greatest tragedy in any man\'s life is sin because the result of sin
is a far-reaching disorder that starts in the very center of his being
and spreads outward to affect all those around him. In the Sacrament of
Penance Our Lord sorts out all those misplaced elements; in addition to
pardoning the sins, he restores to the soul its lost order and harmony.

A well-made confession brings much good to all those who live and work
with us. It\'s a benefit to very many other people with whom we come
into contact in the course of the day. The grace that we receive in this
sacrament means that we say and do everything in a very different way.

Not only that, but when a Christian goes to Confession, the whole Church
receives an incalculable benefit. Every time a priest pronounces the
words of absolution, she rejoices and is mysteriously enriched, because
every Confession, through the Communion of Saints, sends blessings which
resound through the whole Mystical Body of Christ.

In the intimate life of the Church---whose cornerstone is Christ---every
member supports all the others with his good works and merits, and is at
the same time supported by them.

We all need to be, and in fact we all are, continually receiving a share
in the spiritual benefits which are common to us all. Our own merits are
helping our fellow men in every part of the world.

In the same way, sin, lukewarmness, venial sins, and self-satisfied
mediocrity weigh down every member of the pilgrim Church: "If one member
suffers," St. Paul says, "all suffer together; if one member is honored,
all rejoice together."

In his apostolic exhortation, Reconciliation and Penance, Pope St. John
Paul II says: "This is the other aspect of that solidarity which, on the
religious level, is developed in the profound and magnificent mystery of
the Communion of Saints, thanks to which it has been possible to say
that 'every soul that rises above itself raises up the world.'"

"To this 'law of ascent' there unfortunately corresponds the 'law of
descent.' Consequently, one can speak of a 'communion of sin,' whereby a
soul that lowers itself through sin drags down with itself the Church
and, in some way, the whole world.

"In other words there is no sin, not even the most intimate and secret
one, that exclusively concerns the person committing it. With greater or
lesser violence, with greater or lesser harm, every sin has
repercussions on the entire ecclesial body and on the whole human
family."

Whenever anyone makes a sincere and repentant Confession it is a moment
of rejoicing, not only for the penitent but for everybody. When she had
found the lost coin, a lady in Scripture "called together her friends
and neighbors, saying, 'Rejoice with me'" (Lk 15:9).

The saints in Heaven, the holy souls in Purgatory, and the Church which
is still on pilgrimage through this world rejoice together every time an
absolution is given. To loosen the chains of sin is at the same time to
tighten the bonds of brotherhood.

We should go to this Sacrament more joyfully and more regularly when we
know that by the very fact of making a good Confession, we are helping
so many other Christians, and especially those who are closest to us.

Our Lord, knowing that we were fragile, left us the sacrament of
Penance, where the soul not only comes away healed, but, if it has lost
grace, rises with a new life.

We need to go to the sacrament with a sincerity that is complete,
humble, contrite, and with the desire of reparation. A well-made
Confession presupposes a deep examination of conscience. Deep does not
necessarily mean long in a time sense, especially if we go to confession
frequently. If possible, it can be in front of the tabernacle, and
always in the presence of God.

In his examination of conscience, the Christian sees what God has
expected his life to be and what in reality it has been. He sees the
goodness or the malice of his actions, the omissions, the opportunities
he has let slip\..., the gravity of the fault committed, the length of
time he has remained in it before asking for forgiveness.

The Christian who wants to have a refined conscience, and so goes to
Confession frequently, will not be content with a Confession that is
simply valid, but will aspire to be a good Confession which is an
effective help to the soul in its aspiration towards God.

For frequent confession to achieve this end, we need to take this
principle in all seriousness: without repentance there is no forgiveness
of sin.

This gives rise to the fundamental norm of anyone who goes to Confession
frequently---not to confess any venial sin without first seriously and
sincerely repenting of it.

We are told by one writer: "There is a 'general repentance.' This is
pain and detestation for all the sins committed in one\'s past life.
This general repentance is of exceptional importance for frequent
confession," since it helps to heal the wounds that our weakness has
left behind, it purifies our soul and makes it grow in love with God.

Whenever necessary, sincerity will lead us to get down to those little
details that enable us to acknowledge our weaknesses better:

How? When? Why? For how long?

We have to avoid insubstantial and prolific detail just as much as
generalization. We need to say simply and delicately what has happened,
what is the true state of our soul.

We have to flee from digressions such as *I wasn\'t humble, I was lazy,
I lacked charity*: things that are applicable to almost every human
being. When we practice frequent confession, we have to make sure it\'s
always a personal act in which we ask God\'s forgiveness for very real
specific weaknesses, and not generalizations.

This sacrament of mercy is a sure refuge: in it our wounds are cured.
What was already worn and growing old is rejuvenated. All our errors,
large or small, are cured, because Confession is not only a judgment in
which our transgressions are forgiven, but also a medicine for the soul.

Confession that is impersonal often hides a point of pride and of
self-love that seeks to camouflage or to find justification for anything
that is humiliating and leaves us, humanly speaking, looking bad.

It can help us to make this act of penance more personal if we\'re
careful about the way we make our Confession: "I accuse myself of\...",
for this sacrament is not to woefully relate things that have happened;
it is humbly and simply to accuse oneself of one\'s errors and
weaknesses before God Himself, who will forgive us through the priest
and will inundate us with His grace.

St. Josemaría in *The Forge*, Point 238, said, "'Blessed be God,' you
said to yourself after having finished your sacramental Confession. And
you thought: it is as though I had just been born again. You then
continued calmly: 'Lord, what would you have me do?' And you yourself
came up with the reply: 'By the help of your grace I will let nothing
and no one come between me and the fulfillment of your most Holy Will:
*Serviam---*I will serve you unconditionally.\"

I will serve you, Lord, as you have always wanted me to: with
simplicity, in the midst of all the ordinary, everyday events of my
life.

There are many reasons why this sacrament is an incredible gift. These
reasons should move us to be thankful to Our Lord and to love this
sacrament more every time we receive it. Prayerful consideration of
those reasons can help us to be faithful to a plan for frequent
confession.

We should realize that Confession is not merely a spiritual remedy by
which the priest can heal a sick soul or revive a soul dead to the life
of grace. This is a lot, but to our Father God it seems very little.

Remember how in the parable of the Prodigal Son the father did not
forgive his son by means of an emissary. He ran right up to him to
forgive him in person. So it is with Our Lord. He seeks out the sinner.
He makes himself present in the person of the confessor. It is Jesus who
absolves us, since every sacrament is the action of Christ.

We can also give thanks for the universality of this power granted to
the Church in the person of the Apostles and their successors. Our Lord
is ready to forgive everything in everyone, always, as long as He finds
the proper dispositions.

St. Thomas Aquinas says, "God\'s omnipotence is particularly shown in
sparing and having mercy, because in this it is made manifest that God
has supreme power, that He freely forgives sins."

We can ask Our Lord in this time of Advent, in the words of the Church:
"Listen favorably, Lord, to our prayers, and help us in our need. This
coming of your Son brings us comfort. Grant that we may be freed from
the taint of our old habits of sin."

*I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections, and
inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I
ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, Saint
Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.*

*In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
Amen.*

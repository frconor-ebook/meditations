*(Proofread)*

*In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.*

*My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence. I ask your pardon for my sins, and grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My Immaculate Mother, St. Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.*

We are told in Scripture that Our Lady kept all these things, pondering them in her heart. After the consecration of the world to the most sweet and motherly heart of Mary in 1942, many petitions were sent to the Roman Pontiff, asking him to extend to the whole Church the devotion to the Immaculate Heart of Mary that already existed in some places. Pius XII agreed in 1945, certain to find in her most loving heart the safe haven in the midst of the tempests that everywhere assails us. Through the symbol of her heart, he said, we venerate in Mary her most pure and perfect love for God and her motherly love for each one of us. In that heart of hers, he said, we can find a refuge in the midst of all the difficulties and temptations of life. We ask her to prepare for us the safe way, the way by which we will soon reach her Son. "Iter para tutum." Prepare the safe way.

We are told in Scripture, "My heart rejoices in your saving power" (1 Sam. 2:1). The entrance antiphon of today's Mass says, "I will sing to the Lord for his goodness to me." The feast of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, which was celebrated yesterday, helps us to consider the heart as an expression and symbol of a person's innermost being. In the Gospels, the first time the heart of Mary is mentioned is to express all the richness of Our Lady's interior life. We are told in St. Luke, "Mary kept all these things, pondering them in her heart" (Luke 2:19).

The preface of the Mass attributes a number of qualities to the heart of Mary. It is wise because she understood the meaning of the Scriptures as no other person had ever done, and she kept in it the memory of the words and things relating to the mystery of salvation. It is immaculate, that is, immune from any stain of sin. It is docile because she submitted so faithfully to God's will and to every one of his wishes. It is new, according to the ancient prophecy of Ezekiel, "A new heart I will give you and a new spirit" (Ezek. 36:26), clothed in the newness of grace merited by Christ. It is humble because she imitated the humility of Christ, who said, "Learn from me for I am gentle and humble in heart" (Matt. 11:29).

It is simple, free from any duplicity and full of the spirit of truth. It is clean and thus able to see God according to the words of the Beatitude, "Blessed are the clean of heart for they shall see God" (Matt. 5:8). It is firm in her acceptance of the will of God. When Simeon announced to her that a sword of sorrow would pierce her heart, when persecution broke out against her Son, or when the moment of his death was at hand, Mary remained firm in her acceptance of God's will. It is ready, for while Christ slept in the sepulchre, she kept watch in the expectation of his resurrection, just like the spouse in the Canticle of Canticles.

The Immaculate Heart of Mary is called above all "Temple of the Holy Spirit," said the Second Vatican Council, by reason of her divine motherhood and because of the continuous and all-embracing habitation of the Holy Spirit in her soul. This sublime maternity that places Mary above all other created beings was accomplished in her immaculate heart before it was accomplished in her most pure womb. The Fathers affirm, says St. Augustine, that she conceived the Word to whom she gave birth according to the flesh, first of all in her heart according to faith.

By her immaculate heart full of faith and love, a heart that was humble and totally dedicated to the will of God, Mary merited to carry the Son of God in her virginal womb. She always protects us as a mother. As a mother protects her small child who is everywhere surrounded by dangers and difficulties, she helps us grow continuously. How can we possibly prevent ourselves from turning to her each day? Mary, star of the sea, be our guide.

In The Forge, St. Josemaría says, "Make this resolute request because there is no storm that can shipwreck the most sweet heart of Mary. When you see the storm coming, if you seek safety in the firm refuge that is Mary, there will be no danger of your being hurled off course or going down." In her heart we find a safe harbor where it is impossible for us to flounder.

Mary treasured all these things, all these words, and pondered them in her heart, we are told in the Communion Antiphon. She kept in her heart the angel's announcement about her divine motherhood. She kept it as she would keep a treasure. She kept forever in her heart all the things that happened on that night in Bethlehem: all that the shepherds said in front of the manger; the presence days or months later of the Magi with their gifts; the prophecy of Simeon; and the difficulties of her journey into Egypt.

Later a deep impression was made on her heart by the loss of her Son at the age of twelve in Jerusalem, and the words he spoke to her and St. Joseph when in a state of great distress they found him at last. "He went down with them and came to Nazareth and was obedient to them. And his mother kept all these things in her heart" (Luke 2:51).

During all the years she lived on earth, Mary never forgot the events that surrounded the death of her Son on the cross and the words she heard Jesus say as he hung there: "Woman, behold your son" (John 19:26). As he pointed to John, she saw each one of us and all mankind. From that moment on, she loved us in her heart with a mother's love, with the same love as that with which she loved Jesus.

In us she recognized her Son. Just as he himself had said, "As you did it to one of these, the least of my brethren, you did it to me" (Matt. 25:40). But Our Lady had already acted as a mother before the redemption was consummated on Calvary, for she had been our mother from the moment when, with her fiat, she gave her cooperation to the salvation of men.

In the account of the wedding at Cana, St. John reveals a truly maternal feature of the heart of Mary: her attentive concern for others. A mother's heart is always attentive, vigilant. A mother never fails to notice anything that affects her child in any way. In Cana, the motherly heart of Mary bestows her caring vigilance on some relatives or friends of hers so that they can remedy a situation that might have been embarrassing, but would not have had any really serious consequences.

The Evangelist, by divine inspiration, wanted to show us that she is not indifferent to anything human and that nobody is excluded from her fervent tenderness. Our little faults and mistakes, just as much bigger faults, are the object of her concern. She is interested in everything that can affect our souls, from our little bouts of forgetfulness and anxiety to the greater worries that we might sometimes have.

She says to her Son, "They have no wine" (John 2:3). Everyone else is otherwise occupied. Nobody else is aware of it. Even though it seems that the hour of miracles is not yet come, she is able to make it arrive sooner. Mary knows the heart of her Son well and she knows how to reach it. Now in heaven her attitude has not changed. Through her intercession our prayers reach the Lord's presence sooner, more certainly, and better.

That is why today we can address to her the ancient prayer of the Church: "Remember, O virgin mother, you who are always in his presence to speak good things about us. Say something to him in our favor. We need it so much."

As we address this beautiful prayer to Our Lady, it is perhaps not a matter of proposing to ourselves yet another devotion, but of learning to talk to her with more trust, with the simplicity of small children who run to their mothers at every moment. They don't talk to them only when they have great need, but also when they are worried by the little things that happen to them. Their mothers gladly help them to solve even the smallest problems. All earthly mothers have learnt this from the mother in heaven.

As we consider the splendor and holiness of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, we can examine today the depths of our own soul. Whether we are open and docile to the graces and inspirations of the Holy Spirit. Whether we jealously guard our heart from anything that could separate it from God. Whether we pull up by the roots our little feelings of resentment or of envy which tend to bed themselves down within it. We know that from our heart's richness or its poverty our words and deeds will speak. We are told in St. Matthew, "The good person out of the good treasure of their heart, they bring forth good things" (Matt. 12:35).

From Our Lady there springs forth torrents of the graces of forgiveness, of mercy, of help in times of necessity. That is why we ask her today to give us a heart which is pure, human, understanding towards the defects of the people around us. We can ask her to make us kind to everyone, to help us to understand people's sorrows, whatever their circumstances, and always to be ready to help anyone who needs our assistance. "Mother of fair love, pray for us."

Teach us, said St. John Paul II, to love God and our fellow men as you have loved them. Make our love for others always patient, benign, full of respect for them. Make our joy always authentic and complete so that we can communicate it to everyone.

We can recall today when the needs have been pressing, how the Church and her children have turned to the most sweet heart of Mary so as to consecrate the world, nations, and families. We have always had the intuitive feeling, said Pius XII, that it is only in her sweet heart that we are safe.

Today we can dedicate to her once again all that we are and all that we have. We place on your motherly lap the days that seem good and those that seem bad, our illnesses, weakness, work, our tiredness, and our rest, together with the noble ideals that God has placed in our souls. We place especially in your hands our journey towards Christ so that you may keep it free from all dangers and guard it with tenderness and fortitude just as a mother does. Cor Mariae dulcissimum iter para tutum. Most sweet heart of Mary, prepare for me, for all, a safe way.

The opening prayer of today's Mass says, "Father, you prepared the heart of the Virgin Mary to be a fitting home for your Holy Spirit. By her prayers may we become a more worthy temple of your glory."

Mary's humility pours forth in the Magnificat. "My soul magnifies the Lord and my spirit rejoices in God my savior" (Luke 1:46--47). This prayer has a singular beauty. A lady in Asia once told me that when I read those words I could spend hours and hours just contemplating them. Mary glorifies God for making her the mother of the Savior, which is why future generations will call her blessed. God always has a preference for the humble. He is always taking care of the chosen people in accordance with his promise and now gives them the greatest honor by becoming a Jew.

The soul of Mary overflows in the Magnificat---overflows with peace, with joy, and gratitude. St. Josemaría says, "How great is the value of humility." "He has looked upon the lowliness of his handmaid" (Luke 1:48). Not of her faith, nor of her charity, nor of her immaculate purity that Our Mother speaks in the house of Zachary. Her joyful hymn sings, "Since he has looked on my humility all generations will call me blessed."

Pope John Paul says in the words of the Magnificat, Mary's personal experience, the ecstasy of her heart shines forth. In them shines a ray of the mystery of God, the glory of his ineffable holiness, the eternal love which as an irrevocable gift enters into human history. The Magnificat is a fabric woven from words of Sacred Scripture. It shows how Our Lady lived in a permanent conversation with the word of God and thus with God himself.

Don Javier Echevarría, former prelate of Opus Dei, said therefore let us learn from Mary and speak personally with the Lord, pondering and preserving God's words in our lives and hearts so that they may become true food for each one of us.

Our Lady can help us to see that we are called to be an instrument in the hands of the artist. The virtue of humility can be the foundation and the source of a Christian spiritual life. Only if we live humility well can we live charity and unity. Sometimes we don't realize how much Our Lord uses us as instruments. That humility hopefully leads us to a deeper knowledge, to honesty, to realism, to strength. It leads us to dedication, to give ourselves to something greater than ourselves. Mary, may you teach us to leave the progress of our personal apostolate in the hands of the Holy Spirit. Our Lord will do great things through us if we are humble. "Ask of me and I will give you the nations for your inheritance, the very ends of the earth for your domain" (Ps. 2:8).

In The Forge, St. Josemaría says to give oneself sincerely to others is so effective that God rewards it with a humility filled with cheerfulness. This virtue is a virtue of great souls who find their reward in the act of giving. The generous person knows how to give without demanding, giving and not just the heart. Mary, may you help us to maintain and to strengthen our generosity. Don't let our generosity diminish with the passage of time. When there is generosity and self-giving in a family, there is peace, serenity, and joy.

Happiness in this world is found through giving and self-giving. Our Lady and St. Joseph are continual examples of that. Generosity expands the soul, and God loves generosity. The easiest way to save our soul is through self-forgetfulness. On the ruins of our self-love, God wants to build this castle of our sanctification.

We could examine our conscience and see: is there some thought at the back of my mind that I am superior? Help me, Mary, to realize that I am nothing. I am a trash can, a garbage can. But what happens if I am treated like that? I am nothing, but what happens when others treat me as nothing? St. Josemaría has said you are humble not when you humble yourself, but when you are humbled by others, humbled by life, humbled by health, humbled by finances, humbled by this world, and you bear it for Christ.

Our Lady teaches us the virtue of humility which frees us to love and serve others selflessly, for their sake rather than our own. True humility is not feeling bad about yourself or having a low opinion of yourself or thinking yourself as inferior to others. True humility frees us from the preoccupation with ourselves, whereas a low self-opinion can tend to focus our attention on ourselves.

Mary, may I learn from you how to be more humble, to be truly humble of heart as Jesus has asked of us. Our limitations are no obstacle to being faithful. It is enough to be humble and allow God to act through our correspondence, to work great things in our life. First and foremost, to let ourselves be formed. If we don't let ourselves be formed over the passage of time, then God may not be able to do all sorts of things with us. "God resists the proud but gives his grace to the humble" (James 4:6). We see that Our Lady was all the time humble of heart.

Mary, on this beautiful feast day, we have greater recourse to your Immaculate Heart, and ask you to fashion our heart after the wonderful model of your beautiful heart.

*I thank you my God for the good resolutions, affections, and inspirations that you have communicated to me during this meditation. I ask your help to put them into practice. My Immaculate Mother, St. Joseph, my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.*

*In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.*
